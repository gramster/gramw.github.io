    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.grahamwheeler.com/posts/zite-replacement-1.html">previous post</a> I gave an overview of what needs to be built for our <a href="http://zite.com/">Zite</a> replacement. In this post we will look at how to load an RSS feed and generate key terms for each article. In order to fetch the feed we will make use of the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser">feedparser</a> package, so make sure to install that first with pip, conda, or whatever you use.</p>
<p>Another thing we're going to want is to strip HTML tags from the articles. I did a Google for "HTML element stripper Python" and found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/753052/strip-html-from-strings-in-python">this StackOverflow post</a> with the code below that works great:</p>

<p>With that, let's begin. One of the things we will want to do is normalize capitalization of words. In particular, the first word in a sentence is capitalized and we want to in most cases undo that so we don't see two forms of the same word. One solution is to lower-case everything but that is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. A better solution is to look up each word in a dictionary. If we fail to find a match we can try the lower-case form.</p>
<p>There are probably libraries already to do this (NLTK?) but I did some early prototyping of the code in this post using the top 5000 words from <a href="http://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp">this list</a>. So for now I'll just use that as a dictionary to normalize words. There are much more comprehensive lists out there without frequency information and I expect I'll replace this but due to my early experiments I had the word list loaded already.</p>
<p>If you're interested in using that list, you can copy/paste it into a spreadsheet and save it as a CSV once you have agreed to the terms. I used the code below to load that CSV file. I also put the top 198 words in a separate list that I was going to use to remove <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stop words</a>, but I ended up not needing that.</p>

<p>The method we will use to get topics is something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency</a> (TF-IDF). It essentially works by taking the frequency of a term in a document, and multiplying it by the log of the inverse of the number of documents the term occurs in. The idea is that the key terms will be words that occur frequently in <em>this</em> document relative to how frequently they occur in <em>all</em> the documents. Obviously words like 'the', 'and', etc have a high frequency in most documents, so they aren't interesting. But if a word that is uncommon in all the documents, like, say, 'pneumonia', occur relatively higher in a specific document, then that word is likely important.</p>
<p>A key part of this is that we need to count how many documents a word occurs in, not just how often it occurs in each document. So our next function is going to look at all the articles in a feed. Ideally we would compute the IDFs from a bigger corpus of documents, so that can be refined later (in fact, I used the top 5000 words as an alternative and they worked quite well too, but if every article in a feed include some boiler plate text, using the top 5000 words may not filter that out, but computing IDF just from the articles will).</p>

<p>And we're basically done! Let's see how well it worked. We can try it out on the HuffPost and print out the top ten terms for each article:</p>

<p>Running this right  now gives the results below. Not bad for a first attempt! Note that the titles that are printed out were not included in the term counts and so are a good test (although in practice it would make sense to include these so they can help rank the terms).</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>The two most used apps on my phone are <a href="http://zite.com/">Zite</a> and <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>. Unfortunately last year Zite was bought by Flipboard and has slowly been getting worse. Recently the top sticky article on Zite has been a post on migrating your preferences to Flipboard, but suggests Zite is not much longer for this world.</p>
<p>This would be okay if Flipboard was a suitable replacement, but it isn't. It's very flashy (which I don't like), and just doesn't seem to get things right when it comes to serendipitous discovery of interesting content. My feeling is that it is probably a great app for people who are interested in news and pop culture, but my interests run more specialized; I want to read about certain programming languages and fields of math, computer science and statistics.</p>
<p>A few days ago Zite had a half day outage and I decided that it was time to hedge my bets. If no-one else has made the app that I want, I'll just have to do it myself.</p>
<p>So what is involved? Amongst other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a corpus of documents of potential interest</li>
<li>a way of determining the topics discussed in each document</li>
<li>a way of classifying the documents into a broader set of categories, based on the topics</li>
<li>a way of ranking each document within the category</li>
<li>a database or some other store for the results, and an API to query these</li>
<li>an app to consume the resulting content in a way that is easy to use, efficient, and supports various options like blocking sites that are not interesting, upvoting/downvoting the suggested results to improve future results, and saving/sharing the results. Such an app would require some form of identity for personalization, assume I'm not the only one using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the app part, the rest of these are all back-end server tasks, and while the amount of data to be processed may be large the task is not too hard. As for the app, I realized an easy solution at first is to not build an app at all. There are other ways to consume the results; for example a daily digest e-mail, or saving the results straight to an app like Pocket or Evernote from where they can be read/deleted/etc. This loses the ability to upvote/downvote/etc but that can come later.</p>
<p>As for the corpus of documents that serve as input, there are a number of ways to source these:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSS feeds are an obvious first choice</li>
<li>Digest-style e-mails that contain useful sets of links - e.g. O'Reilly has weekly newsletters in areas like Programming, Big Data, etc that can be great input (especially as it is already curated)</li>
<li>Posting on social community groups like G+ communities</li>
<li>Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn postings by thought leaders </li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ideas; the first source will definitely be RSS feeds though as they have many useful properties in their metadata.</p>
<p>The main other challenge is the classification task. This is typically going to involve supervised machine learning which means you need a large collection of previously classified articles to learn from.  Thankfully RSS includes article categories so hopefully that will be enough to go on.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough talk. In my next posting I'll look at how to do step 2, namely topic extraction, from RSS feeds.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>A long time ago when dinosaurs roamed the earth I was following an academic career. That got subverted but I
enjoyed it while it lasted. Apart from graduate courses in compilers, I got to teach everything from 
computer architecture to assembly language programming to an introductory computing course for social
science students.</p>
<p>When teaching assembly language (in which I was lucky enough to be able to use the M68000, a dream of a 
processor), one of the samples I used to illustrate a number of topics like multi-dimensional arrays,
recursion and function pointers, was a Mine Sweeper game. I recently dug it out and turned in into Python
just for the heck of it.</p>
<p>So here it is. There are no fancy graphics, the field is just printed out as a 2D array of ASCII characters.
To enter a move you use coordinates using a number for the row and letter for the column. E.g. 1C is the
first row, third column (rows are numbered from 1, not 0). You can plant a flag (or clear it) by preceding 
your move with a '-'.</p>
<p>At some point I might look at using PyQt or something to turn it into a mouse-driven more attractive looking
game. But the interesting stuff is the recursive traversal of the board.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I mentioned in a previous post that I would talk about Maslow's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Hierarchy of Needs</a> in relation to team health. </p>
<p>Maslow described a set of layers of needs with respect to human motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li>physiological - the basic needs for survival (food, water, shelter, air, etc)</li>
<li>safety - health, well-being, security</li>
<li>love/belonging - friends and family</li>
<li>esteem - respect of others and (more importantly) self-respect</li>
<li>self-actualization - becoming the most you can be</li>
<li>self-transcendence - altruism and given of yourself to others</li>
</ul>
<p>Maslow considered the first four to be necessary for mental health and a pre-requisite for self-actualization
and transcendence.
This hierarchy of needs is a useful model; it's not science but can help us understand shortcomings in ourselves
and others that may need addressing to reach our full potential.</p>
<p>So how does this relate to teams and management? We can come up with a similar set of needs for healthy teams 
and team members:</p>
<ul>
<li>physiological - this goes without saying unless you're trying to operate in a war zone</li>
<li>safety - as a tech worker, this usually isn't an issue so I'll take it as a given too</li>
<li>belonging - in a team context this relates to psychological safety. Do you have a hostile workplace? Or do people feel safe to be themselves? Are roles and reponsibilities clear? Are team members supportive of one another or are they trying to stab each other in the back? This relates to organizational culture - can you get ahead while helping others grow or by pushing them out of the way? The former is healthy while the latter is not. </li>
<li>esteem - do people take their work seriously? Do you hire good people? Are people dependable and good are meeting their commitments? Do people have clear goals and are there well-understood processes?</li>
<li>self-actualization - do people enjoy their jobs? Do they feel like they are learning/growing? Do you have the right people doing the right work, so that they are motivated and excited about what they are doing individualy?</li>
<li>self-transcendence - as a team, do people think their work matters and they are making a difference in the world? Do you have a clear vision statement so everyone understands what they are working towards collectively? Do you celebrate your accomplishments together?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use these layers as a way to think about, evaluate and improve the health of your team.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Are you a people manager? Do you enjoy doing 1-1s with your reports? No? Then you're doing them wrong!</p>
<p>1-1s are a valuable and important part of both managing your team and becoming a better manager. You should see them as as much for your benefit as for your reports - arguably more so! Not only are you getting the opportunity to keep your reports on track and on a growth path, but it's a great opportunity to get feedback yourself. Unless you're the kind of manager who thinks managing is all about giving orders and having them carried out, in which case this post isn't for you; go enlist or something.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why managers (and employees) don't enjoy 1-1s:</p>
<ul>
<li>there isn't enough to talk about</li>
<li>there is no personal rapport</li>
<li>lack of social skills make them uncomfortable</li>
<li>there is a real performance issue that is festering</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these should be real issues if 1-1s are done correctly.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, "there isn't enough to talk about" - this is typically because you are meeting too often or not planning the content of your meetings. Unless there is a serious HR or performance issue being addressed, you don't need weekly 1-1s. In most cases every two weeks is just fine, and in some cases (where teams work closely and have daily stand up, etc, so everyone knows what others are doing) once a month may be enough. Twenty minutes to half an hour should be plenty of time.</p>
<p>As for topics for discussion, this is a good reason to have your reports keep a log of their work. If you are
keeping track of what people are doing through daily standup, the 1-1 is more of a retrospective. It's a time
to discuss recent achievements, perhaps to celebrate them, or to do a post-mortem and figure out how they
could have gone better. It's also a time for you to get feedback from your report on how you are doing as
a manager, and what you can do to help make your reports more productive, happy and motivated (I'll discuss
some of this more in a future post in relation to Maslow's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Hierarchy of Needs</a>). In other words, 1-1s are best suited as ways to keep a regular review/feedback 
loop going, not for goal setting/tracking. The excepttion is career development discussions, which are forward
looking. A key part of this is that there should be no surprises if when you come to annual or bi-annual 
performace reviews; these should be perfunctory if the 1-1s are bing done right. The worst managers I have 
had have always been ones in which there was a total disconnect between what was being said in 1-1s and what
happened in the performance review (admittedly, some toxic cultural approaches to performce reviews can force
these surprises on people regardless but if they happen its likely your manager has been a poor advocate for 
you).</p>
<p>As far as a lack of personal rapport - how do you think this will ever develop if you don't take the time to try to develop it? You should use some of the time to get a sense of your report's interests and life outside of work. Like it or not, people bring their emotional baggage with them to work and if you want to have physically and mentally healthy people on your time you should take an interest in people's lives.  Much the same goes for a lack of social skills (I assume your report has this problem, else why are you a manager?). Make your reports comfortable and this will not be an issue.</p>
<p>Outside of performance issues uncomfortable 1-1s are more likely environmental in nature. Are you sitting behind a desk and having a conversation in a way in which there is an obvious imbalance of power? At the very least get on the same side of the desk as your report. But much better than that - get out of the office. Go take a walk. It's a great way to conduct 1-1s; it is refreshing, you don't need to make eye contact much (immediately eliminating much of the social discomfort), and it has a calming influence on all involved. If you are lucky enough to work in a nice area, the walk itself could be enough to make everyone look forward to their 1-1s. And that is a real measure of success.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>It's been a long time since I last blogged. I've been meaning to for oh so long but you know what they say about the road to hell. For a while I maintained my <a href="http://www.magimathics.com">math blog</a> but even that has been fallow for some time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I stumbled upon Peter Norvig's <a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html">article</a> about solving Sudoku, and that has provided the impetus. His approach is probably the most sensible I have seen for a while; there seem to be some really bad solvers out there. I was unimpressed with the one by Skiena in the  <a href="http://www.algorist.com/">Algorithm Design Manual</a>,  although the truly ridiculous one has to be the so-overblown-I-took-a-whole-book approach in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Sudoku-Technology-Action-Wei-Meng/dp/1590596625">Programming Sudoku</a>;  the mind simply boggles at how complex some people make trivial things.</p>
<p>Because solving Sudoku is indeed trivial. There is nothing to it. All you need is a very simple backtracking search. I wrote the solver below originally more than 10 years ago in Javascript and it was used as a generator running on extremely low-powered Microsoft SPOT smart watches. For fun I dug it out, turned it into Python, and tested it on <a href="https://www.kristanix.com/sudokuepic/worlds-hardest-sudoku.php">"the world's hardest Sudoku puzzle"</a>. How fast can you blink?</p>
<p>But still some people <a href="https://gigaom.com/2012/10/12/meet-the-algorithm-thats-way-better-than-you-at-sudoku/">make a big deal out of it all</a>...</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I have an MSI Wind on which I run both Windows 7 and Ubuntu. I rarely
use the latter but I like to keep it around and with a 320GB hard drive
its affordable. I have used both the Windows BCD loader and GRUB as my
bootloader at various times (and for those using BCD I highly recommend
<a href="http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1">EasyBCD</a> as the way to configure it).
Most recently I've been using GRUB.</p>
<p>Yesterday I installed Windows 7 RC and my boot sector got clobbered by
BCD. I had a bit of a had time getting things working again. I first
tried using EasyBCD but this time when trying to boot Ubuntu I ended up
at a GRUB prompt, and I could not access my Ubuntu partition (more
precisely, while "root (hd0,2)" worked, "kernel /vmlinuz" threw errrors
and I could not boot).</p>
<p>In the end I got things working using the Ubuntu live CD and
reinstalling GRUB. However, it required more than just doing a
grub-install - for some reason the BIOS drive mappings seem to have been
messed up. I did a web search and I found a lot of people have had this
problem and very few found the solution so I thought it was worth
mentioning what I did to make mine work in the hope it is useful to
others.</p>
<p>In my case my primary Ubuntu partition is the 3rd partition; i.e.
/dev/sda3. After booting the live CD and opening the terminal, here is
the set of commands I used to get things working again:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
sudo mount -t proc /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo chroot /mnt
grub-install --recheck /dev/sda
update-grub
</pre>


<p>Without the mounts of /proc and /dev, /dev/sda won't be found after the
chroot. The --recheck option is necessary because somehow the BIOS drive
mappings have gotten confused. It's possible the update-grub step is not
necessary but I think it is safest to rebuild the grub config; I read at
one web posting where someone omitted this step and after rebooting was
left at the GRUB prompt again.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Hopefully by now you all have v3.0 of the Live Search client, and are
enjoying the new features (web search, weather, and collections). I'd
like to talk about collections in this post, but first it is worth
mentioning a couple of changes in this version that are less obvious,
and overcome limitations I have blogged about in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>we now have Outlook contact integration. From Outlook contacts you
    can select the "Show on Map" menu option to map a contact. <a href="http://geekraver.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3690236EA2D48605!203.entry">Google
    Maps contacts integration is still
    broken</a>,
    but we can't let that hold us back any longer; we gave them nearly a
    year as well as explicit instructions on what their bug was; if they
    can't get their house in order with all that then too bad for them.
    If you do want to use both GMM and Live Search, then install GMM
    last. Their bug will cause problems with any other software that
    installs menu extensions that is installed after them; if the other
    apps are well-behaved then you can install them before GMM and you
    should be okay.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://geekraver.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3690236EA2D48605!181.entry">we have put back the ability to enter addresses in the search
    box</a>.
    We have a better geocoder now on the back end and are more confident
    that you will get the results you want when doing this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, on to GeoRSS. This was my pet feature that I originally built in
September 2006 and it finally got shipped (and if you say 'about time!'
then I have the names of the two people who kept trying to kill this to
give to you; go blame them ;-))</p>
<p><a href="images/georss-image0.png"><img alt="image" src="images/georss-image0.png"></a></p>
<p>The Collections feature is built around Virtual Earth collections, to
make it easier for people who don't know/care about GeoRSS to use the
feature and get some value out of it. For the more hard-core, you can
enter GeoRSS URLs directly:</p>
<p><a href="images/georss-image1.png"><img alt="image" src="images/georss-image1.png"></a></p>
<p>The actual collections/feeds are stored in the application directory in
a file called feeds.xml. You may find it instructive to look at that
file.</p>
<p>The cool thing about the URLs is that they can contain metatokens, which
will expand to location-specific values:</p>
<p><a href="images/georss-image2.png"><img alt="image" src="images/georss-image2.png"></a></p>
<p>For example, the URL above:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.homethinking.com/georss/@StateAbbrev@/@City@">http://www.homethinking.com/georss/@StateAbbrev@/@City@</a></p>
<p>has two such metatokens, namely @StateAbbrev@ and @City@. These will get
converted into appropriate values based on your search location before
the feed is fetched.</p>
<p>The supported metatokens are:</p>
<ul>
<li>@StateName@ - state name, e.g. "Washington"</li>
<li>@StateAbbrev@ - state name abbrevaited form e.g. "WA" (outside the
    USA this will be the same as @StateName@)</li>
<li>@City@ - city name</li>
<li>@Zip@ - zip or postal code</li>
<li>@Location@ - the full text shown in the main view for the current
    location</li>
<li>@Latitude@, @Longitude@</li>
<li>@StartLocation@, @StartLatitude@, @StartLongitude@, @EndLocation@,
    @EndLatitude@, @EndLongitude@ - similar to @Location@ etc but for
    the start and end points of the last route you calculated. The idea
    being you could pass these up to a transit service to get, for
    example, a bus schedule</li>
<li>@MyLatitude@, @MyLongitude@, @MyLocationTime@ - the location and
    time (in UTC) of the last GPS fix</li>
</ul>
<p>In a later post I'll describe the GeoRSS schema that the client
understands (it is a hybrid of GeoRSS, some Yahoo extensions, some KML
and some OASIS xADR address stuff). For now I'll just mention one
interesting extension, namely pushpinurl, which can point to a .ico
file. This file will be used as the pushpin icon on the map for that
result. This can allow you to make custom pushpins.</p>

<p>I heard this proof a couple of days back and thought it was fun and
elegant. If you draw a circle anywhere on the surface of the earth there
will be at least two opposite points that have the same temperature.</p>
<p>The proof relies on <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BolzanosTheorem.html">Bolzano's
theorem</a>, which is an
instance of the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IntermediateValueTheorem.html">Intermediate Value
Theorem</a>.
Bolzano's theorem says that if a continuous function defined on an
interval is sometimes
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Positive.html">positive</a> and sometimes
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Negative.html">negative</a>, it must be 0 at
some point.</p>
<p>We assume that temperature on any path on the earth's surface is
continuous. If <em>f(x)</em> is a continuous function, and <em>g(x)</em> is a
continuous function, <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuousFunction.html">then <em>f(x)-g(x)</em> is also
continuous</a>.</p>
<p>So, choose some starting point on the circumference of the circle, and
let f(x) be the temperature at the point at offset x clockwise from the
starting point, and let <em>g(x)</em> be the temperature at the point opposite
that point. If the temperature at some point x is warmer than at its
opposite point x', then <em>f(x)</em>-<em>g(x)</em> is positive, while <em>f(x')</em>-<em>g(x')</em>
is negative. So, by Bolzano, there is a point where <em>f(x)</em>-<em>g(x)</em>=0,
i.e. <em>f(x)</em>=<em>g(x)</em>.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p><em>"Assertions are the only reliable form of program documentation"</em>
(Charles Hoare)</p>
<p>While I wait for the next release of Live Search for Mobile, I will fill
in the time with some posts on tricks I have used in the dim and distant
past, before I became a mostly C# programmer. I love C#, but I really
don't like the way the C/C++ preprocessor was not included. While
preprocessors can be abused, they are also extremely useful (think of
__FILE__ and __LINE__, just for starters).</p>
<p>In particular, the preprocessor in C and C++ provides a very flexible
assertion mechanism that is much more useful then System.Diagnostics.
I'd like to cover some useful ways of using assertions in C and C++. Of
course if you're an Eiffel programmer, you can probably stop reading ;-)</p>
<p>In the code below, I will assume the existence of a library function
<strong>HandleAssert(char* message</strong>), which does appropriate assertion
handling (for example, in a GUI app it might pop up a message box,
display the message, and give a Continue/Abort/Debug choice).</p>
<p>Obviously, the first thing we need is a basic ASSERT macro:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="cp">#ifdef DEBUG</span>
<span class="cp">#define ASSERT(condition, message)     do { if (!(condition)) HandleAssert(message); } while (0)</span>
<span class="cp">#else</span>
<span class="cp">#define ASSERT(condition, message)</span>
<span class="cp">#endif</span>
</pre>


<p>The first rule of asserts is, of course, never put them in production
code, hence the DEBUG conditional. The use of a do/while above
eliminates any possible dangling else issues that might otherwise crop
up if for some weird reason you put your ASSERTs in if statements.</p>
<p>The above is often the only form of ASSERT that most C/C++ programmers
encounter. But there are quite a few useful variants on the idea.
Sometimes, just an alias is already a useful distinction:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="cp">#define PRECONDITION(condition, message)     ASSERT(condition, message)</span>
<span class="cp">#define POSTCONDITION(condition, message)    ASSERT(condition, message)</span>
</pre>


<p>It can be useful to be able to define code that only exists in
assertional builds:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="cp">#if DEBUG</span>
<span class="cp">#define ASSERTIONAL(code)      code</span>
<span class="cp">#else</span>
<span class="cp">#define ASSERTIONAL(code)</span>
<span class="cp">#endif</span>
</pre>


<p>Putting all of the above in an example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">AdvanceIndex</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">index</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">ASSERTIONAL</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">save_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">index</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">PRECONDITION</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">index</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Index can't be negative"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">....</span>

    <span class="n">POSTCONDITION</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">index</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">save_index</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Index must advance"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">index</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>


<p>If we have class invariants, it is useful to define these as methods in
the class that we can call from our asserts:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">foo</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="cp">#if DEBUG</span>
   <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">invariant</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">...</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">#endif</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>


<p>During early development, we could confine ourselves to DEBUG builds. In
this case we may want to skip over handling of bad input, etc. We can do
this safely using simplifying assumptions:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="cp">#if DEBUG</span>
<span class="cp">#define SIMPLIFYING_ASSUMPTION(condition,  explanation)      ASSERT(condition, explanation)</span>
<span class="cp">#else</span>
<span class="cp">#error SIMPLIFYING_ASSUMPTION not allowed in&gt; release code</span>
<span class="cp">#endif</span>
</pre>


<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">Insert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">node</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">PRECONDITION</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">invariant</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="s">"Can't insert null"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">SIMPLIFYING_ASSUMPTION</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Not handling re-insertion of existing node yet"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="n">POSTCONDITION</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">invariant</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="s">"Node must be inserted"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>


<p>Note, when writing unit tests for code that has pre- and
post-conditions, you should be striving to write tests that pass the
precondition but fail the postcondition. Thus assertions can provide
very useful test case selection guidance. Pre- and post-conditions also
tend to be more stable than the code inside methods, reduce the need to
examine the internal code, and, for the hard-core, support proving
correctness.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may find it useful to always fire the assert:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="cp">#define UNREACHABLE(why)      ASSERT(0, why)</span>
</pre>


<p>We can have compile-time assertions on simple expressions:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="cp">#define COMPILE_TIME_CHECK(b)    extern int dummy[(b) ? 1: -1]</span>
</pre>


<p>As you can see from all of this, the lowly ASSERT can be quite flexible!</p>

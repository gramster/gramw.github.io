<p>In a <a href="http://magimathics.com/monkeying-around">previous
post</a> I
wrote about how Fermat scribbled his famous “last theorem” in the margin
of Diophantus’ <em>Arithmetica</em>. This is called Fermat’s last theorem not
because it was the last thing Fermat wrote but because of all the
incomplete theorem’s we know were left by Fermat it was the last to be
proved, taking about 350 years.</p>
<p>The section of the book where Fermat wrote his comment was on finding
<em>Pythagorean triples</em>: square numbers whose sums also form squares. Such
numbers can be the sides of Pythagorean (right-angled) triangles, the
most well know being 3-4-5.

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>In the late 1980s I was contracted to write some software for a company
that produced video-based educational systems. They had video cassette
machines that had been modified to interface with a PC, which could send
instructions to the VCRs such as play, stop, fast forward, and rewind.
The educational programs consisted of short recorded segments which
typically ended with a question, and based on the answer the user
provided they wanted to continue play at different portions of the tape.
The software they wanted me to write was meant to be able to be given a
current position (i.e. play time) and advance to a new position. For
example I might be told that they are at minute 8 currently and want to
resume play at minute 12.

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>My 5 year old daughter wanted to heat something up in the microwave. I
suggested she use a minute, and she asked me how to enter that. I said
enter 1, 0, 0, Start. “But when mom tells me to do a minute she says 6,
0, Start”, she responded. I wasn’t sure how to explain to her that 1:00
minute is the same as 60 seconds; microwaves are confusing enough to her
as is.</p>
<p>So why are there are 60 seconds in a minute? Why not 100? The answer
lies about 4000 years ago, in some of the earliest known mathematics, of
Sumeria and Babylon. The Sumerians and later the Babylonians used a
<em>sexagesimal</em> (base 60) number system for their astronomy (although they
used decimals for day-to-day applications). They had no way to represent
non-whole numbers other than as fractions, and 60 was a convenient base
as it has a large number of factors; in particular it can represent 1/2,
1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6 all with whole numerators. In fact sexagesimal
notation can be used to exactly represent any fraction in which the
denominator has prime factors of 2, 3, and/or 5 (as these are the prime
factors of 60), with a finite number of symbols.

<p>After a huge storm blew up, the ship foundered. Dawn’s light found just
six survivors washed up on a desert island – five men and one monkey.
The men spent the day gathering all the food they could find – which was
just a pile of coconuts. After a dinner of coconut milk and flesh, the
exhausted men decided to they would divide the remaining coconuts up the
following day, before splitting up and exploring the remainder of the
island.</p>
<p>During the night one man woke up and started worrying about whether
there would be a disagreement in the morning over the coconuts. He
decided to take his share, and divided the coconuts equally into five.
There was one left over which he gave to the monkey, then he took his
share and hid them away, before going back to
sleep.<a href="images/image6.png" style="float:right;size:35%;margin:10px"><img alt="image" src="images/image_thumb6.png" title="image"></a>

<p>In the Indian city of Benares, beneath a dome that marks the center of
the world, is a brass plate in which are set three diamond needles, each
as thick as a bee and a cubit high. At the time of creation Brahma
placed on one of these needles 64 disks of pure gold, each a different
size, each resting only on plates of a larger size (so the largest disk
was at the bottom and the smallest at the top).</p>
<p>In the temple are priests whose task is to transfer all the disks to a
different needle, moving only one disk at a time between needles but
never placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one. When the task is
done, tower, temple and Brahmins all will vanish with a thunderclap and
the world will vanish.</p>
<p>So how much time do we have left?

<p>I have an MSI Wind on which I run both Windows 7 and Ubuntu. I rarely
use the latter but I like to keep it around and with a 320GB hard drive
its affordable. I have used both the Windows BCD loader and GRUB as my
bootloader at various times (and for those using BCD I highly recommend
<a href="http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1">EasyBCD</a> as the way to configure it).
Most recently I've been using GRUB.</p>
<p>Yesterday I installed Windows 7 RC and my boot sector got clobbered by
BCD. I had a bit of a had time getting things working again. I first
tried using EasyBCD but this time when trying to boot Ubuntu I ended up
at a GRUB prompt, and I could not access my Ubuntu partition (more
precisely, while "root (hd0,2)" worked, "kernel /vmlinuz" threw errrors
and I could not boot).

<p>Hopefully by now you all have v3.0 of the Live Search client, and are
enjoying the new features (web search, weather, and collections). I'd
like to talk about collections in this post, but first it is worth
mentioning a couple of changes in this version that are less obvious,
and overcome limitations I have blogged about in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>we now have Outlook contact integration. From Outlook contacts you
    can select the "Show on Map" menu option to map a contact. <a href="http://geekraver.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3690236EA2D48605!203.entry">Google
    Maps contacts integration is still
    broken</a>,
    but we can't let that hold us back any longer; we gave them nearly a
    year as well as explicit instructions on what their bug was; if they
    can't get their house in order with all that then too bad for them.
    If you do want to use both GMM and Live Search, then install GMM
    last. Their bug will cause problems with any other software that
    installs menu extensions that is installed after them; if the other
    apps are well-behaved then you can install them before GMM and you
    should be okay.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://geekraver.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3690236EA2D48605!181.entry">we have put back the ability to enter addresses in the search
    box</a>.
    We have a better geocoder now on the back end and are more confident
    that you will get the results you want when doing this.</li>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I heard this proof a couple of days back and thought it was fun and
elegant. If you draw a circle anywhere on the surface of the earth there
will be at least two opposite points that have the same temperature.</p>
<p>The proof relies on <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BolzanosTheorem.html">Bolzano's
theorem</a>, which is an
instance of the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IntermediateValueTheorem.html">Intermediate Value
Theorem</a>.
Bolzano's theorem says that if a continuous function defined on an
interval is sometimes
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Positive.html">positive</a> and sometimes
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Negative.html">negative</a>, it must be 0 at
some point.</p>
<p>We assume that temperature on any path on the earth's surface is
continuous. If <em>f(x)</em> is a continuous function, and <em>g(x)</em> is a
continuous function, <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuousFunction.html">then <em>f(x)-g(x)</em> is also
continuous</a>.</p>
<p>So, choose some starting point on the circumference of the circle, and
let f(x) be the temperature at the point at offset x clockwise from the
starting point, and let <em>g(x)</em> be the temperature at the point opposite
that point. If the temperature at some point x is warmer than at its
opposite point x', then <em>f(x)</em>-<em>g(x)</em> is positive, while <em>f(x')</em>-<em>g(x')</em>
is negative. So, by Bolzano, there is a point where <em>f(x)</em>-<em>g(x)</em>=0,
i.e. <em>f(x)</em>=<em>g(x)</em>.</p>

<p><em>"Assertions are the only reliable form of program documentation"</em>
(Charles Hoare)</p>
<p>While I wait for the next release of Live Search for Mobile, I will fill
in the time with some posts on tricks I have used in the dim and distant
past, before I became a mostly C# programmer. I love C#, but I really
don't like the way the C/C++ preprocessor was not included. While
preprocessors can be abused, they are also extremely useful (think of
__FILE__ and __LINE__, just for starters).</p>
<p>In particular, the preprocessor in C and C++ provides a very flexible
assertion mechanism that is much more useful then System.Diagnostics.
I'd like to cover some useful ways of using assertions in C and C++. Of
course if you're an Eiffel programmer, you can probably stop reading ;-)

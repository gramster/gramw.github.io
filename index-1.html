    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I was searching a couple of days back for a tool that would generate
dependency matrices for C# code. I didn't find free ones, but I did
find a <a href="http://tcdev.free.fr/">plugin</a> for Lutz Roeder's
<a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Reflector</a> that will do this for
compiled assemblies, which is just as good. I haven't done a fresh
install of reflector for quite some time and didn't know it supported
add-ins, but it does and there are a few good ones.</p>
<p>The dependency matrix tool is absolutely fantastic, and I highly
recommend it. Amongst other things it will generate a report that
includes cyclic dependencies. Just that is worth its weight in gold.
Cyclic dependencies typically creep in when you make short cut kludges
to hack in some inappropriate type-dependent logic into a class.  As
such, its usually an indication of a design break, and it also makes
unit testing harder. Use this tool, look at any cycles it reports, and
fix them. Your code will be better as a result.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Last night I decided to try write a web browser that has the ability to
take screen captures. I have an
<a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=7946">rss2book</a>
program that I wrote for my <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=PRS500U2">Sony
Reader</a>
which has been great at producing PDF content from the web (mostly RSS
but it is not limited to that). However, I figured that for some
content, especially that which is largely Javascript driven, it might be
better to capture the full content of a web page as an image and then
turn that into a <a href="http://www.djvuzone.org/">DJVu</a> document (the Sony
Reader doesn't actually support DJVu, but I imagine that there will be
e-book readers soon that do - or at the least there's always the Nokia
N800).</p>
<p>Essentially, this app needs to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>host the AxWebBrowser Active/X control</li>
<li>have a 'Capture' button that, when clicked, will grab the entire
    page as an image and write it to a JPEG file</li>
</ul>
<p>The first part is easy. The second part involves a couple of steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>resizing the host form so that the full page fits with no scroll
    bars</li>
<li>somehow grabbing the contents of this form</li>
</ul>
<p>It took a little while to figure out hwo to solve the first problem, but
once you know it's easy:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>IHTMLDocument2 doc = (IHTMLDocument2)webBrowser.Document;
IHTMLElement2 body = (IHTMLElement2)doc.body;
this.Width += (body.scrollWidth - webBrowser.Width);
this.Height += (body.scrollHeight - webBrowser.Height);
</pre>


<p>However, the second problem is really hard. I already had some code I'd
written which does window captures. The problem is that if the window is
obscured or clipped anywhere it gets no content for that area. Given
that I am typically resizing the form to have a height much larger than
my display's physical resolution I'm almost always going to have
clipping occur.</p>
<p>In .Net 2.0 there is an alternative, namely
<font face="Courier">Control.DrawToBitmap</font>. That actually works
wonderfully for WinForms controls - but it does not draw anything for
Active X controls (or at least not for AxWebBrowser). My understanding
is that the control must be able to handle WM_PRINT messages, although
I'm not entirely convinced of this explanation, because it is
inconsistent with my experience with
<font face="Courier">PrintWindow</font> (see below).</p>
<p>I tried calling <font face="Courier">RaisePaintEvent</font> on the form
and passing in a Graphics object created from a bitmap - but that
doesn't work either. Only the form is drawn, not any of the child
controls (so all you really get in most cases is a blank image with a
border).</p>
<p>I tried P/Invoking <font face="Courier">PrintWindow</font> from
user32.dll, but that suffers from the same clipping problem that my
original window grabbing code has. So I'm still stumped here. Watch this
space to see if I find a solution. In the meanwhile, if you don't have
Active/X controls to worry about, I recommend
<font face="Courier">Control.DrawToBitmap</font>; it is simple and works
well.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> I found my code that accesses the ActiveX control broke with
IE7. I rewrote it using the Windows.Forms.WebBrowser classes in .Net
2.0. They work fine. There is still no Control.DrawToBitmap though,
presumably because these classes are just wrapping the underlying
ActiveX control.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>There's been some weird synchronicity going on recently. It started a
few weeks back at work. Earlier this year I wrote a compiler for
Javascript, and this resulted in a conversation with a workmate about
virtual machines. I mentioned the SECD machine and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0133315797/wishwatcher-20/">Henderson's seminal
book</a>
from 1980 on functional programming. My workmate was interested enough
to order a copy, and we've had a number of conversations about
functional programming (which I haven't done in 20 years). At some point
in this process I ended up getting the <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf#search=%22map%20reduce%22">Google paper on
map/reduce</a>,
and the paper on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/tmp/history.pdf#search=%22history%20of%20Haskell%22">a history of
Haskell</a>.
A few days later <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html">Joel wrote about map/reduce and
Javascript</a> on his
blog. Then I ended up almost inadvertently getting a copy of Danny
Hillis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262580977/wishwatcher-20/">Connection
Machine</a>
book.  Today I read <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/LarryO.html">Eric Sink's posting about multicore CPUs and
Erlang</a>, in which he also
mentioned <a href="http://knowing.net">Larry O'Briens blog</a> - so I head over
there and the <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,beab1a93-151b-44b1-9d5e-a61f077ec036.aspx">third posting
down</a>
discusses a problem very similar to the deadlock issue I just posted
about.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I got bitten today with a nasty deadlock in my code. It took a while to
unravel as this particular code involves large numbers of threads making
parallel web service requests. I thought I'd share the particular gotcha
that tripped me up.</p>
<p>For performance reasons, all my calls are aynchronous. I have a callback
for reading HTTP response data, which included the following (grossly
simplified here to just show enough to illustrate the problem):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>private void ReadCallBack(IAsyncResult result)
{
    int bytesRead = response.EndRead(result);
    if (bytesRead &gt; 0)
    {
        HandleData(buffer, bytesRead);
        lock(this)
        {
            // kick off next read
            response.BeginRead(buffer, 0, len, new AsyncCallback(ReadCallBack), this);
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p>It was important to the logic of my program that I <em>not</em> hold the lock
when calling HandleData. However, it turns out that if there is already
data available, the call to BeginRead will not queue a callback on a
different thread but will do the callback immediately itself on the same
thread - so the nested call to HandleData will happen within the locked
region!</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I tend to be one of those people who accumulates vast amounts of clutter
on my desk, in my room, and in my life, and then every couple of months
has a big cleanout, vowing to maintain the new uncluttered state, but
the cycle just begins again (I blame the laws of thermodynamics). In an
effort to break that cycle I've recently started paying some attention
to David Allen's <a href="http://davidco.com">Getting Things Done</a> approach.</p>
<p>I haven't read his books (part of my clutter is a large number of unread
books; his book was among them for a while until it went back to the
library), but there is enough info on the web to get the idea. There is
also a good description in the wonderful book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596013/wishwatcher-20/">'Micro-ISV: from Dream to
Reality</a>'
by Bob Walsh. One of the first things I did was look for software that I
could use to start implementing the GTD approach. The two main
contenders seemed to be Bob Walsh's own <a href="http://safarisoftware.com/">Masterlist
Professional</a>, which is very reasonably
priced at \$25, and a Ukrainian product called <a href="http://www.mylifeorganized.net/">MyLife
Organized</a>, which costs \$60. I
downloaded both and tried using them.</p>
<p>Sadly (as I like everything else I've seen from Bob Walsh) Masterlist
Professional got eliminated almost immediately because it supports only
flat lists (projects broken into items). MyLife Organized, on the other
hand, supports tree structured hierarchical lists, which I find more
appropriate. So I'm about 5 days into the trial and am using MLO daily.
However, I find the price to be pretty exhorbitant for what is
essentially a glorified todo list manager. I could probably write my own
subset of MLO that does what I need in a few hours in C#, and that
gives me the added benefits of (i) being able to customise it to my
liking and (ii) being able to sell it later if it is good enough. Watch
this space.</p>
<p>So far the biggest drawback of MLO seems to be that using the Pocket PC
version to try to keep two PCs in sync does not work; things get messed
up quickly. The developers suggest using a USB thumb drive to carry
thedaya file around on, but I opted for synching the data file to my
subversion server.</p>
<p>Unrelated note: Windows LiveWriter works great! It may make me update
this blog a lot more regularly.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I've been going through old CD-R discs of mine with a view to reburning
them on DVD-R to safe some space and generally clean them up. It's
amazing what I'm finding - things that I had totally forgotten having
written. For example, I found a SNMPv1/v2 MIB compiler and browser that
I wrote back in 1995. Until I saw it I had no recollection that I even
did that! After some reflection it all came back. In May 1995 I started
Open Mind Solutions with two friends from university days. Our plan was
to do work for hire to finance the development of a software product. At
that stage I had quite a bit of experience with SNMP, having recently
implemented RMON while working for Mosaic Software. It seemed that there
was a lack of good network management software, and what was available
was hugely expensive (HP OpenView pretty much had the market). We felt
that we could build a worthy competitor to OpenView based on FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Our first job was to raise money, and for that I wrote a network-enabled
clone of HP's advmail X400 mail client for Wooltru. HP's client had to
run on the same machine as the server, which didn't scale at all in
large enterprises like Wooltru. IBM had sold Wooltru a RS6000 server and
OpenMail license, but this was just not going to work, and heads were
about to roll. HP wouldn't commit to fixing this, but referred Wooltru
to a British company that did a lot of OpenMail development. They said
it would take at least 9 months and several million pounds to fix
advmail. We told Wooltru we would write them a complete clone of advmail
that worked over TCP/IP in six weeks, for about \$15,000 (yes, we were
naive, at least in our pricing, but this was South Africa, and that
seemed like a lot of money). It took me four weeks (working 16 hour
days, 7 days a week) to deliver an almost bug-free system that Wooltru
used for several years as a mail client for (IIRC) about 50,000 staff.
That still ranks as one of my two greatest programming feats (my partner
Ian thankfully wrote the text for the hypertext help system - which was
a feature unique to our version; HP's didn't have any).</p>
<p>I used the C++ class library I built on top of ncurses for advremote as
the basis for the SNMP browser, which I started working on after
advremote (our name for our client). It took about two weeks to build a
pretty cool (albeit text mode) SNMP browser/manager app. However, IBM
(through whom we had done the Truworths work) then kept me real busy
writing vertical applications for the beverage retail industry for the
next six months, and the SNMP work gathered dust, which is probably why
I have now all but forgotten about it. Because six months later Aztec
Information Management asked us to write a management front-end for the
Firewall Toolkit (fwtk). And when I saw the awful code in fwtk, and
decided to write my own toolkit in C++, we ended up with our eventual
product, the Citadel Firewall, almost by accident. In less than a year
we changed our names from Open Mind Solutions (oms.co.za) to Citadel
Data Systems (cdsec.com), and the rest is history (for me, anyway). CDS
was eventually bought out by CEQURUX Technologies BV; Ian took cash and
went on to do an MBA in France and became a venture capitalist, while I
took shares and stayed on at CEQURUX - who then fell victim to the dot
com bubble burst. This left me near broke at age 37 and resulted in my
move to the USA. Ce'st la vie.</p>
<p>One point of note in my trawling - my CD-R's go back to 1996. The ones
burnt then are largely unreadable now. It seems anything more than one
directory level deep is lost, and a fair bit more beside. Those burnt in
1998 also have problems, although they're mostly okay. Anecdotaly I
would put the lifetime of a CD-R backup now at no more than 5 years. You
have been warned.</p>

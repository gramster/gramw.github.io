<p>Ashley, Steve and I are giving a talk at MEDC on our baby, Live Search
for Mobile. Ash will talk about interaction design for mobile, I'll talk
about lessons learned and useful tips for developing on Compact
Framework (Live Search is built on CF 1.0 SP3), and Steve will talk
about our uber-agile process. Stop by and say hi!</p>
<p>Update: you can see the video <a href="http://blip.tv/file/220788">here</a> -
although it seems to bomb out before I started talking. When I saved it
to my local drive it worked fine, so I'm not sure what the issue is with
streaming it.</p>

<p>I was searching a couple of days back for a tool that would generate
dependency matrices for C# code. I didn't find free ones, but I did
find a <a href="http://tcdev.free.fr/">plugin</a> for Lutz Roeder's
<a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Reflector</a> that will do this for
compiled assemblies, which is just as good. I haven't done a fresh
install of reflector for quite some time and didn't know it supported
add-ins, but it does and there are a few good ones.</p>
<p>The dependency matrix tool is absolutely fantastic, and I highly
recommend it. Amongst other things it will generate a report that
includes cyclic dependencies. Just that is worth its weight in gold.
Cyclic dependencies typically creep in when you make short cut kludges
to hack in some inappropriate type-dependent logic into a class.  As
such, its usually an indication of a design break, and it also makes
unit testing harder. Use this tool, look at any cycles it reports, and
fix them. Your code will be better as a result.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Last night I decided to try write a web browser that has the ability to
take screen captures. I have an
<a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=7946">rss2book</a>
program that I wrote for my <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=PRS500U2">Sony
Reader</a>
which has been great at producing PDF content from the web (mostly RSS
but it is not limited to that). However, I figured that for some
content, especially that which is largely Javascript driven, it might be
better to capture the full content of a web page as an image and then
turn that into a <a href="http://www.djvuzone.org/">DJVu</a> document (the Sony
Reader doesn't actually support DJVu, but I imagine that there will be
e-book readers soon that do - or at the least there's always the Nokia
N800).</p>
<p>Essentially, this app needs to do the following:

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>There's been some weird synchronicity going on recently. It started a
few weeks back at work. Earlier this year I wrote a compiler for
Javascript, and this resulted in a conversation with a workmate about
virtual machines. I mentioned the SECD machine and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0133315797/wishwatcher-20/">Henderson's seminal
book</a>
from 1980 on functional programming. My workmate was interested enough
to order a copy, and we've had a number of conversations about
functional programming (which I haven't done in 20 years). At some point
in this process I ended up getting the <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf#search=%22map%20reduce%22">Google paper on
map/reduce</a>,
and the paper on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/tmp/history.pdf#search=%22history%20of%20Haskell%22">a history of
Haskell</a>.
A few days later <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html">Joel wrote about map/reduce and
Javascript</a> on his
blog. Then I ended up almost inadvertently getting a copy of Danny
Hillis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262580977/wishwatcher-20/">Connection
Machine</a>
book.  Today I read <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/LarryO.html">Eric Sink's posting about multicore CPUs and
Erlang</a>, in which he also
mentioned <a href="http://knowing.net">Larry O'Briens blog</a> - so I head over
there and the <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,beab1a93-151b-44b1-9d5e-a61f077ec036.aspx">third posting
down</a>
discusses a problem very similar to the deadlock issue I just posted
about.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I got bitten today with a nasty deadlock in my code. It took a while to
unravel as this particular code involves large numbers of threads making
parallel web service requests. I thought I'd share the particular gotcha
that tripped me up.</p>
<p>For performance reasons, all my calls are aynchronous. I have a callback
for reading HTTP response data, which included the following (grossly
simplified here to just show enough to illustrate the problem):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>private void ReadCallBack(IAsyncResult result)
{
    int bytesRead = response.EndRead(result);
    if (bytesRead &gt; 0)
    {
        HandleData(buffer, bytesRead);
        lock(this)
        {
            // kick off next read
            response.BeginRead(buffer, 0, len, new AsyncCallback(ReadCallBack), this);
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p>It was important to the logic of my program that I <em>not</em> hold the lock
when calling HandleData. However, it turns out that if there is already
data available, the call to BeginRead will not queue a callback on a
different thread but will do the callback immediately itself on the same
thread - so the nested call to HandleData will happen within the locked
region!</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I tend to be one of those people who accumulates vast amounts of clutter
on my desk, in my room, and in my life, and then every couple of months
has a big cleanout, vowing to maintain the new uncluttered state, but
the cycle just begins again (I blame the laws of thermodynamics). In an
effort to break that cycle I've recently started paying some attention
to David Allen's <a href="http://davidco.com">Getting Things Done</a> approach.</p>
<p>I haven't read his books (part of my clutter is a large number of unread
books; his book was among them for a while until it went back to the
library), but there is enough info on the web to get the idea. There is
also a good description in the wonderful book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596013/wishwatcher-20/">'Micro-ISV: from Dream to
Reality</a>'
by Bob Walsh. One of the first things I did was look for software that I
could use to start implementing the GTD approach. The two main
contenders seemed to be Bob Walsh's own <a href="http://safarisoftware.com/">Masterlist
Professional</a>, which is very reasonably
priced at \$25, and a Ukrainian product called <a href="http://www.mylifeorganized.net/">MyLife
Organized</a>, which costs \$60. I
downloaded both and tried using them.

<p>It is very funny, particularly as it is so spot on! Probably because it
comes from Microsoft marketing people.  Even though I personally
wouldn't buy an iPod (I have an 8Gb Zen Micro, and can't wait for the

<p>I've been going through old CD-R discs of mine with a view to reburning
them on DVD-R to safe some space and generally clean them up. It's
amazing what I'm finding - things that I had totally forgotten having
written. For example, I found a SNMPv1/v2 MIB compiler and browser that
I wrote back in 1995. Until I saw it I had no recollection that I even
did that! After some reflection it all came back. In May 1995 I started
Open Mind Solutions with two friends from university days. Our plan was
to do work for hire to finance the development of a software product. At
that stage I had quite a bit of experience with SNMP, having recently
implemented RMON while working for Mosaic Software. It seemed that there
was a lack of good network management software, and what was available
was hugely expensive (HP OpenView pretty much had the market). We felt
that we could build a worthy competitor to OpenView based on FreeBSD.

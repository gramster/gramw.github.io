    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>A common source of confusion for our users is the distinction we make
between 'what' and 'where'. We generally search for 'what' (which is the
text you can enter on the main form), centering the results on the
'where' (which is the location shown just below). If you want to change
the location, <em>or if you want to search for an address</em>, you need to
click on 'Choose a new location'; you can then enter the address on the
Location screen and click 'Find' (note: the screen shots shown below
come from a test version of the app we run on the desktop; the menus at
the top will be on the bottom on your phone, accessible via the two
softkeys; I just used the desktop version here as it was quicker for
me):</p>
<p><a href="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBubcKxBhXBHiF5wxlbx7rbsWacM1pycCrsRRP90lgmae_DV5yxgmZ19ihX7hjVACpE?PARTNER=WRITER"><img alt="image" src="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBuKMThFUcoLUuA2a8qL_hlYotP9UT4tIAubhQ3CsZmDL6W44Lk1KUp1E4eoo_V7NJI?PARTNER=WRITER"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBsflSxvtiSEBaR59Vw2kPpOidvJbM5SimjvYktlC3CZSuE0OJxFWToeeRtXOiAdo7E?PARTNER=WRITER"><img alt="image" src="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBubt8zFX1Oj8NMawibS1R3BVP0cc7ryarimA0pvDzh49jAWDq21NFjzOblWVtam6tg?PARTNER=WRITER"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBu-fc50UQqgpK-9dk-BJE0eQI4jfvx6iI8isrEzl4qbDLhttb3EWDj9iTaravRObmk?PARTNER=WRITER"><img alt="image" src="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBtRlJq1kjSN5yzmLJS1fMqx3iYFqHOTSIE57sMX67jSU3AgDJ9p1aPlsH51gdeuxcw?PARTNER=WRITER"></a></p>
<p>The app will then try to locate the address you entered, and if
successful will show you the result, after which you should click
'Done':</p>
<p><a href="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBtrH4Bd0kxYX8-2Rxisx1ybUa0LsJCq0uUE-3BPCfTU0iy1aFGZ1BFQSQZqbPaY2Sc?PARTNER=WRITER"><img alt="image" src="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBvfibw9VK5w7FDRScSMG_z345AreYrD1oEu6GwniWVUhhrxLDlgqQL51RyRnfEhL68?PARTNER=WRITER"></a></p>
<p>You'll then be back in the main view with the new address shown as your
search location:</p>
<p><a href="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBvgo8D883CET1sH83Alvma_fYiqeFDTQ0CfcKFRwoUX5GBDODnfqHa6LOolqZLpJjI?PARTNER=WRITER"><img alt="image" src="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBuVI0Az9AbBHr1RVnGXAjj1MHPxP9s8mv-Yxa6k9yBCgvuOIe9YSGAIQEnpZ3kc8o8?PARTNER=WRITER"></a></p>
<p>You can the click on the Map icon to show a map centered on this
address, or do a search (which will be centered on the address), or
click on Directions for directions. There is something odd about
directions, though - we use your set location as the start point instead
of the end point:</p>
<p><a href="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBs5L8EGDsqvc8Bx2SxUoN_hFYuPXwDthkpUX159EwgWIB-q2nKlb6YatTOJDljVORI?PARTNER=WRITER"><img alt="image" src="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBvgTL65sq7jrLOHQgLPIwk7y81hhlMXkrLn0GSIXg0YQECWuvaf72i-xnpFGlDjYNU?PARTNER=WRITER"></a></p>
<p>You can use left or right DPad actions to spin through the location
lists to change this, or, if the shown end point is actually your start
point, you can just do the route and then reverse it:</p>
<p><a href="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBvmm41JZjtWhWcEpxFsUYKtqE4ZtvXvND0-VlGVqxyQi0qjvtRJRN8Jhn2wp-ReCvI?PARTNER=WRITER"><img alt="image" src="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pAcgpTMaaCBtgB0-kAlJJlHWfwwHhHvC8Wac50R3le-WU1gOW6CyRFyeGft1yE3IiSvMJ4PcEFfk?PARTNER=WRITER"></a></p>
<p>"But why don't you just allow addresses in the search box?", I hear some
of you ask. Well, the white page and yellow page search services that we
consume don't support mixed queries of what and where together, and we
didn't want to try make the app on the phone second guess what you're
trying to do (actually early versions of the app did do this - if the
what/where search failed we would try again treating the what as a
where - but that produced some strange results so we took it out).</p>
<p>The good news is that there are services now that we can use that do
support mixed queries so in some future release we should handle this
much better.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I run a mostly Windows-only setup at home these days. My home setup
consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>an SBS2003 server mostly for Exchange mail, which also runs FreeBSD
    in a virtual machine to keep some older services running on Apache
    (primarily the redirector from geekraver.com to Live Spaces and my
    subversion repository).</li>
<li>a Windows Home Server, which has taken over the file server
    functionality from SBS2003, as I like its more flexible file
    replication</li>
<li>a media center PC running Vista Ultimate</li>
<li>a kitchen internet appliance running Windows CE</li>
<li>Vista Ultimate PCs for each of my kids (and a laptop for the wife)</li>
<li>a desktop PC and a Tablet PC for me with Vista Ultimate</li>
<li>an oldish Mac Mini G4 which was running Leopard</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm mostly pretty happy with Vista. I love the Media Center especially
now with an HDHR attached (we only get \$15 limited cable). My kids have
pretty good success running old games; I'd say about 90% of their games
run on Vista, and considering some of them harken back to Windows 3.1
that's not too shabby. The parental controls made Vista a no-brainer for
their machines. The Mac is the odd one out - but I keep it around mostly
because I love Handbrake on the Mac; its the best way to move my DVDs
into a library that is easily accessible from the Media Center. There is
a Windows port - and I could run it way faster on my desktop - but the
lack of a video preview to determine things like crop and de-interlace
settings take away much of the coolness compared to the Mac version.</p>
<p>When Leopard came out I installed it on my Mini - even though I didn't
really need to. I'm not really the target market, and to me it's only
been mildly annoying; it hasn't added any value. But I'm going back to
Tiger. Tonight I came home and my Mac had a message on the screen saying
I needed to restart my compute - and it explicitly instructed me to do
so by power cycling, rather than shutting down (I was locked out of any
alternatives anyway). Since power cycling it does not finish booting. I
get the Apple logo, then a blue screen with just a mouse cursor.</p>
<p>I know we go through cycles of copying each other, but I never thought
Apple would want to emulate the BSOD. I only hope I can manage to do a
non-destructive re-install of Tiger so as not to lose some files I had
on the machine.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>We get a lot of people reporting problems with their hardware keyboards
on phones like the VX6800. When they press the letter keys instead of
letters they get numbers and symbols.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is a problem with the IME (input method editor) in
the phone. IMEs are often customized by the phone OEM or the mobile
operator to add functionality like predictive text input. For a number
of phones, an IME was added that breaks text input from the keyboard
with all .Net Compact Framework apps. In many cases we're the only such
app on the phone, so users understandably think its a bug in our
program. We wish it was - in that case we could fix it - but there
really isn't anything we can do other than complain.</p>
<p>AFAIK the full set of phones affected is:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTC S630</li>
<li>HTC Titan/Sprint Mogul/PPC-6800.</li>
<li>HTC S720</li>
<li>HTC 5800</li>
<li>Verizon XV6700</li>
<li>Verizon XV6800</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a Titan/Mogul/6800, <a href="http://www.america.htc.com/support/mogul/software-downloads.html">Sprint does have a firmware
update</a>
for the phone which has a fix. The fix requires reflashing your phone,
which means losing all your apps and settings and carries some risk, so
be aware of that.</p>
<p>For the Verizon XV6800, you can get a fix by visiting
<a href="http://www.utstar.com/pcd/view_phone_details.aspx?mcode=XV6800&amp;bID=89&amp;sAct=0">UTStar</a>;
select Verizon Wireless as your carrier then click on Downloads, and
select the QWERTY Keyboard fix. You could try
<a href="http://www.utstar.com/pcd/downloads/XV6800%20QWERTY%20Keyboard%20Fix%201-9-08.zip">this</a>
as a direct link.</p>
<p>If you have one of the other phones I suggest you complain to your
operator; if enough people complain then they might do something. If you
know of fixes for any of these please let me know in the comments and
I'll update the post.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>One thing we have found is that our zoom UI is not very discoverable.
It'll probably change in the future as a result; it seems we
over-engineered it in the current app. But until we come up with a
replacement, here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>obviously you can use the menu Zoom In/Zoom Out to change the zoom
    by one level</li>
<li>if you hit the D-Pad center button you will go into 'zoom mode'.
    While in this mode you can use the right soft key or the D-Pad
    center button to increase the zoom level, and the left soft key to
    decrease the zoom level. You can also pan the zoom box around the
    map with the D-Pad direction keys. If you don't press any buttons
    for about two seconds, then the selected zoom will be performed, and
    zoom mode is exited</li>
<li>if you have a touch screen, you can also quickly double tap on a map
    location to zoom in to that location</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>Several new Sprint phones come with Live Search for Mobile already
installed, with a launch icon on the home page. Unfortunately if you
update the application then this icon stops working. We changed where
the app gets installed whereas the icon Sprint added has a hard-coded
path.</p>
<p>There is a simple fix, however. Install <a href="http://cid-3690236ea2d48605.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/sprint_patch.cab">this CAB

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>If you live in an area where there is no traffic coverage, you may not
want to have the Traffic icon taking up precious real estate on your
home screen. There is a way to re-order the icons, although it is not
for the faint of heart. You need to edit the preferences.xml file in the
\Programs\Live Search directory.</p>
<p>In this XML file there is a section with tags \&lt;il&gt;, and within this
are entries with tags \&lt;it&gt; and \&lt;ip&gt;. The former stands for "icon
tag" (starting with zero) and the latter for "icon position" (starting
with 1). By changing the \&lt;ip&gt; values you can re-order the icons.</p>
<p>While I'm at it, you can also remove locations from the recent location
list; these are in elements that start with \&lt;rt&gt;. A lot of people ask
how to do this. It's worth mentioning though that you don't really need
to do it; unused locations will eventually drop off the list. The list
maintains the 15 most frequent and most recent locations. The number of
questions we get about this does suggest that 15 is overkill and we may
shrink the number down in future.</p>
<p>If you mess things up when editing the preferences.xml file and the app
won't start, just delete the file. The app will create a new clean
preferences file for you when it next runs.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Windows Mobile 6 phones are out and about, and several of them have
built-in GPS. Some people find that the GPS doesn't work well with Live
Search for Mobile, so I hope this post will help explain why GPS can be
tricky. Note that you should make sure you are running the latest
version of Live Search (from December '07) as this has some improvements
in the timeout handling which will help.</p>
<p>First of all, the phones are pre-configured to use the GPS Intermediate
Driver, but Live Search does not know about these phones so by default
GPS is not configured. Make sure you have Live Search set to use GPS
Intermediate Driver (go to Menu-Settings from the main form to access
the GPS settings).</p>
<p>When you first say “Center on GPS” in the map, the phone needs to get
the GPS ephemeris data (which tells it where the various satellites are
located in three dimensional space). That requires a clear line of site
to 3 or more GPS satellites to receive a non-error corrected data
payload that takes 30 seconds to transmit. Move around during this time
and you can interrupt the process. You really need to be outside,
preferably away from tall buildings, and avoid moving in a way that
changes the various paths between your phone and the sky. Just your body
is enough to block the transmission. If you're in your car, try putting
your phone on the dashboard by the windshield for a minute. Note that
even with a clear line of site, this process will take an average of 45
seconds (the \~15 seconds for the current frame to finish transmitting
plus the 30 seconds for the next complete frame).</p>
<p>Unfortunately many people don't know this, and so when they don't get a
fix after about 30 seconds they move around thinking this will help, but
it actually makes things worse.</p>
<p>Once GPS has the ephemeris data it is much more tolerant of errors and
you can move around much more freely while you have a fix. The ephemeris
data that comes over satellite is good for at most 4 hours and then
needs to be refreshed, so the ephemeris retrieval process must be
repeated periodically. Note that even with ephemeris loaded, it still
takes at least 7 seconds to get an initial GPS fix, typically longer.
The bottom line here is that if you do not already have ephemeris, then
even with perfect condition you will need at least 37 seconds to get
your first fix, and the reality is much more likely to be around a
minute. Move around or have obstructions and you could be talking
several minutes.</p>
<p>Some phones (e.g. AT&amp;T Tilt, which has a Qualcomm GPS chipset) have
utilities that can fetch ephemeris over the Internet and prime the chip
that way (this is called QuickGPS.exe on the Tilt), speeding up this
initial step. These have the advantage of being able to fetch much more
than 4 hours of data, potentially up to 7 days (although I think in
reality QuickGPS.exe fetches around 4 days). AFAIK there is no such
utility on the BJ2, nor on the Motorola Q9H. The SirfStar III chipset on
the BJ2 and MQ9h potentially has the capability, depending on the
firmware version loaded on the chip, but I don't believe it's exposed.</p>
<p>If you're quite far north (e.g. Seattle) you should get a fix more
easily if you face south. The reason for this has to do with the
satellite orbits. There are 24 satellites in 6 orbits (4 satellites per
orbit; each orbit takes 12 hours). The orbits are tilted at 55 degrees
to the equator but do not go over the poles. Here is a sample orbit:</p>
<p><a href="images/gpsorbit.jpg"><img alt="gpsorbit" src="images/gpsorbit.jpg" title="gpsorbit"></a></p>
<p>The other five orbits are similar but each is offset by 30 degrees
longitude. You can see from this that if you are in Alaska or Greenland,
for example, all satellites will be to your south. Once you get to
Seattle you're typically going to have about 60% of the visible
satellites to your south. The effect diminishes the closer to the
equator you go, but clearly for the northerly states and Canada facing
south is a good strategy. You can see an example by looking at this
screenshot I took using
<a href="http://www.chartcross.co.uk/products/WM00002_details.asp">GPSTest</a>
outside my office here in Redmond:</p>
<p><a href="images/satellites.jpg"><img alt="satellites" src="images/satellites.jpg" title="satellites"></a></p>
<p>There is a hack floating around on the 'net in the form of a CAB file
that makes the GPS accessible via COM ports. On the BJ2 it enabled COM4
and on the Q9h it enabled either COM5 or COM3, depending on which CAB
file you get. The COM5 CAB on Q9h 'speeds up' the initial fix;
unfortunately the reason it does so is that it keeps the port open the
whole time, and will kill your battery life. The COM3 CAB for Q9 doesn't
keep the port open and won't offer you any speed improvements.</p>
<p>Interesting side note: I've been told that the USAF who provide the
ephemeris data that is transmitted by the satellites only calculate
ephemeris for 24 hours - beyond that the error that creeps in to the
calculations based on Keplerian equations makes the data no good.
However NASA independently calculates much more accurate data
incorporating such things as tectonic shift and is the source of the
multi-day data.</p>

<p>Assertions can be great for detecting unexpected state in your code. But
when a state violation is caught in an assert, the next question is
usually "How did I get here?".</p>
<p>A simple but effective way to track down this kind of issue is the
following: in each class instance allocate a StringBuilder member
(called, for example, stateLog). Then, at each point in the class code
where the state changes, log the change with an appropriate message
(usually a helper method that takes a string message is appropriate
here - it should append the message plus a snapshot of the relevant
member variables to the stateLog). Now, whenever you have an assertion,
you can append stateLog.ToString() to the assertion message.</p>
<p>It's basically like printf debugging where the printfs all get recorded
but don't actually get printed until/unless they become relevant.
Keeping this code in your debug builds is a great defensive technique,
can catch hard to repro bugs, and can save you having to step through
the debugger.</p>

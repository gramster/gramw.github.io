<p><a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> is an interactive computing environment that allows users to create heterogeneous documents called <em>notebooks</em> that can mix executable code, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> text with <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, multimedia, static and interactive charts, and more. A notebook is typically a complete and self-contained record of a computation, and can be converted to various formats and shared with others. Jupyter thus supports a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>. Several of the posts on this blog started out as Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter is an extremely popular tool for doing data science in Python due to its interactive nature, good support for iterative and experimental computation, and ability to create a finished artifact combining both scientific text (with math) and code.</p>

<p>Shankar Vedantam has a great NPR show/podcast, <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510308/hidden-brain">"The Hidden Brain"</a>, and occasional appearances on NPR's All Things Considered.  In December he had a show on Evaluating Personality Tests. It was enjoyable, especially the Harry Potter Sorting Hat references, but I felt it was a missed opportunity because of the focus on Myers-Briggs, and the fact that he mentioned the Big-5 model only in passing.</p>
<p>In fact, Myers-Briggs is not taken very seriously in the psychology world, and Vedantam surprised me with spending so much time on it, given his show's focus on research in psychology. On the other hand, the Big-5 model is taken quite seriously, with many studies and papers based on it and evaluating it in various contexts (take a look, for example, at the Oxford University Press book I link to at the end of this post).</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/12/11/569815338/evaluating-personality-tests">short form NPR segment</a>, this was the section on Big-5 in its entirety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VEDANTAM: Many personality researchers put greater stock in a test known as the Big Five [vs Myers-Briggs]. Grant says the Big Five has lots of peer reviewed data to back it up.</p>
<p>GRANT: We can predict your job performance, your effectiveness in a team with different collaborators, your likelihood of sticking around in a job versus leaving as well as your probability of your marriage surviving, depending on the personality fit between you and your spouse.</p>

<p>I've been teaching <a href="https://github.com/gramster/pythonbootcamp">a crash course in data science with Python</a>, which starts off with learning Python itself. The target audience is Java programmers (generally senior level) so its assumed that things like classes and methods are well understood. The focus is mostly on what is different with Python. I teach it using Jupyter notebooks but the content is useful as a blog post too so here we go:</p>

<p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language. It takes its name from Monty Python's Flying Circus.</p>
<p>Python is a dynamic language but is strongly typed (i.e. variables are untyped but refer to objects of fixed type).

<p>Well, it's been quite a while since I last blogged. My Zite project is not dead; it's actually up and 
running well as a personal aggregator but not ready for multi-user access, and I'm not sure when it
might be. But I've been feeling a bit of an itch to start blogging again so here goes.</p>
<p>I have some material already lined up: I've been teaching an introductory data science bootcamp at
work and thought the notebooks from that could be useful blog posts in and of themselves. So I'll
start slowly publishing those while I write some new material. I'm also going to expand the scope 
of this blog; I'll still cover some tech topics but I',m going to fold in the content from my
dormant math blog and retire it; this may inspire me to do some math blogging again. And I'll be 
throwing in some stuff on management and psychology too. So this will be a mishmash living up to 
the random forest name. I'll use categories to make it more accessible for those only interested
in specific topics.</p>
<p>More soon!</p>

<p>It's been a while since I worked on this but it is still on my mind a lot. I've been mulling over ways to improve categorization without the semi-supervised tweaking I've had to do.</p>
<p>Just to recap, currently this is what I am doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a bunch of 'category exemplars', which are sets of key terms associated with a category. These are the things which currently require some manual work;</li>
<li>for each article, I extract the plain text, normalize capitalization, remove <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stop words</a>, then use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf">tf-idf</a> to extract the set of most significant terms (I'm not yet doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">stemming</a> although I'll probably start);</li>
<li>I then use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">distance metric</a> from the exemplars to assign category scores to the articles. Provided the score exceeds a threshold the article will be considered to be in the category.

<p>I recently started playing guitar again after a long absence and wanted to start making some notes in a digital form. Unfortunately, I didn't find any good tools. There is TeX of course, which can do anything, but I was hoping for something a bit more WYSIWYGy. There are some very good tools available for musical scores (MuseScore, Frescobaldi), but I want something that is more like a traditional notebook with lots of notes interspersed with occasional musical notation (in both traditional and tablature forms).</p>
<p>So an obvious potential candidate is Jupyter (nee IPython), but it has no support for musical notation out of the box. But it is doable and in this post I'll walk through how I got it to work on my Mac. This is also my first attempt at using a Jupyter notebook as my blog post in Nikola so I'm kiling two birds with one stone.

<p>I've spent the past few days refining the web server, largely for diagnostic
purposes, so it can replace the old TkInter app. I can seen articles for 
categories or feeds, their rank, and detailed information on why they 
received particular categories and ranks. This has enabled me to improve
the categorization and ranking algorithms. I'm at a point now where I 
feel I need a lot more sources than the ~4000 I have right now, as well as
more categories. The latter is more complex and will take me back to some
of my earlier explorations in clustering, etc. The former largely involves 
mining more of the web to find useful sites.

<p>Well, I hope you've all brushed your teeth after all that Halloween candy.</p>
<p>Today I'm going to show how I build a simple web server to view my feed
articles using node.js and Express, along with MongoDB. I have a simple 
category classifier which finds the best Jacard similarity (described earlier)
to a set of category exemplars (i.e. 'pseudo-articles' for a category
containing just key words that are typical for that category). It needs a
lot of tuning and the earlier tkInter program was meant for that but tkInter 
proved to have problems. So time to use some more modern techologies!

<p>Happy Halloween, all!</p>
<p>I'm sitting here handing out candy and glow necklaces to all comers so its a
good time to write a new post.</p>
<p>It's been a while since much happened as I've been really busy with the beta 
release of Google Cloud Datalab, which is my day job. But now that is out and
it's the weekend and lousy weather here in the Pacific Northwest it's been a 
good day t get back to things.</p>
<p>Today I did something I've been meaning to do for a while, which is to change
the code to populate a MongoDB database rather than writing files to the file 
system. Interestingly it seems to be quite a bit slower than the file system 
but hopefully it will scale better and make up for things when I have ad-hoc
queries to do.

<p>Things have been slow on the blogging front but there has been progress on the
Zite replacement. I'll write more about that soon but part of what I have been 
doing is looking into what server-side technology to use.</p>
<p>As far as a database goes, this seems like a no-brainer. I'm dealing with JSON
documents that I can either spend some effort on normalizing to put into a SQL 
database, or simply keep them as is and put them in a database that supports 
that form, and the obvious choice then is <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, 
which uses a binary form of JSON.

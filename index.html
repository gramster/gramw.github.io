    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Well, it's been quite a while since I last blogged. My Zite project is not dead; it's actually up and 
running well as a personal aggregator but not ready for multi-user access, and I'm not sure when it
might be. But I've been feeling a bit of an itch to start blogging again so here goes.</p>
<p>I have some material already lined up: I've been teaching an introductory data science bootcamp at
work and thought the notebooks from that could be useful blog posts in and of themselves. So I'll
start slowly publishing those while I write some new material. I'm also going to expand the scope 
of this blog; I'll still cover some tech topics but I',m going to fold in the content from my
dormant math blog and retire it; this may inspire me to do some math blogging again. And I'll be 
throwing in some stuff on management and psychology too. So this will be a mishmash living up to 
the random forest name. I'll use categories to make it more accessible for those only interested
in specific topics.</p>
<p>More soon!</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>It's been a while since I worked on this but it is still on my mind a lot. I've been mulling over ways to improve categorization without the semi-supervised tweaking I've had to do.</p>
<p>Just to recap, currently this is what I am doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a bunch of 'category exemplars', which are sets of key terms associated with a category. These are the things which currently require some manual work;</li>
<li>for each article, I extract the plain text, normalize capitalization, remove <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stop words</a>, then use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf">tf-idf</a> to extract the set of most significant terms (I'm not yet doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">stemming</a> although I'll probably start);</li>
<li>I then use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">distance metric</a> from the exemplars to assign category scores to the articles. Provided the score exceeds a threshold the article will be considered to be in the category.</li>
</ul>
<p>The manual work right now comes in when I notice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives">false positives and negatives</a>. My basic web app has the ability to show me all the common terms that led to a categorization and/or missed terms leading to a missed categorization. I can use these to tweak the category exemplars to improve classification. Its not ideal; I would far prefer to make this all be automated. The plan is to make use of Wikipedia to help with generating category exemplars. I don't think that this will solve the problem entirely but I am hoping to add one level of abstraction here to potentially reduce the amount of tweaking required.</p>
<p>My initial plan is:</p>
<ul>
<li>take each Wikipedia article, extract the plain text (and probably add stemming), remove stop words, generate term counts, and keep track of outgoing links to other articles</li>
<li>reduce the set of articles to a manageable set. Keep only articles that have a reasonable length (after stop word removal), and at least a certain number of incoming links. The values to use here will be determined empirically once I have these values for the articles</li>
<li>for each article, generate tf-idf scores for terms and keep the top terms (i.e. treat them much as my current category exemplars)</li>
</ul>
<p>The good news is that this can all be automated. The bad news is I'm likely to have many thousands of 'categories'. But here is where a second level of abstraction comes in. For each article from the web I want to classify:</p>
<ul>
<li>generate the set of Wikipedia categories for the article (using cosine distance from the Wikipedia exemplars);</li>
<li>use the Wikipedia categories as the new term sets for the articles when categorizing them</li>
</ul>
<p>I.e. instead of categorizing an article based on the significant terms in the article, do so based on the significant Wikipedia categories for the article.</p>
<p>This may seem like a lot of work to come almost full circle but the hope is that these second level exemplars will be more stable and require less tweaking. As for generating the second-order exemplars, I can make use of all the articles I have categorized so far as a training set for supervized learning.</p>
<p>The next problem is dealing wth the Wikipedia dump. Uncompressed it is close to 60GB. The first task is to split it up into separate articles, which I pan to do with <a href="https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor">WikiExtractor</a>. After that I may try use my little 4-node ODroid cluster to do the work, which will be a nice intro to my next couple of posts about that! </p>

<p>I recently started playing guitar again after a long absence and wanted to start making some notes in a digital form. Unfortunately, I didn't find any good tools. There is TeX of course, which can do anything, but I was hoping for something a bit more WYSIWYGy. There are some very good tools availabe for musical scores (MuseScore, Frescobaldi), but I want something that is more like a traditional notebook with lots of notes interspersed with occasional musical notation (in both traditional and tablature forms).</p>
<p>So an obvious potential candidate is Jupyter (nee IPython), but it has no support for musical notation out of the box. But it is doable and in this post I'll walk through how I got it to work on my Mac. This is also my first attempt at using a Jupyter notebook as my blog post in Nikola so I'm kiling two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>I want something that is fairly easy to write the music in. MusicXML isn't too bad, except XML. What little I've seen of Liyponds markup looked pretty unfriendly for the simple use cases I have. A few days ago I stumbled across a Python library called abjad which looked just the ticket. As I write this I have it working for music on the staff but not tablature (I'm not sure it supports that) but I hope by the end of this post I'll have that figured out too!</p>
<p>Abjad relies on Lilypond, so first that has to be installed. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://lilypond.org/macos-x.html">http://lilypond.org/macos-x.html</a>, and then the tarball needs to be uncompressed and the Lilypond.app folder dragged to /Applications. You need to follow the instructions at that link to set up a command line version too. I created a file /usr/local/bin/lilypond for that; my Homebrew install uses that folder so it is already in my path.</p>
<p>Next we need to install Abjad. You should ideally do this in a virtual environment. I use Anaconda and already have one set up, so can do the installation as follows; you may need to prefix this with <code>sudo</code> depending on your setup.</p>

<p>Well, that didn't go so well. It turns out Abjad releases aren't that frequent, and while this issue was fixed over six months ago (<a href="https://github.com/Abjad/abjad/issues/526">https://github.com/Abjad/abjad/issues/526</a>) it hasn't made it into an official release yet (Abjad 2.16 as I write this). If you are using Python 3.4 or earlier this isn't a problem; its a Python 3.5 change.</p>

<p>There are a few things left I'd like to do, and I will update this post if I figure them out. First there is a lot of blank space around the output it would be nice to be rid of. Secondly I want to do guitar chord diagrams. My understanding is that these can be done in Lilypond with a tag <code>\fret-diagram-terse</code> but Abjad doesn't seem to support this so I will need to figure out how to extend it to support that. Watch this space.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I've spent the past few days refining the web server, largely for diagnostic
purposes, so it can replace the old TkInter app. I can seen articles for 
categories or feeds, their rank, and detailed information on why they 
received particular categories and ranks. This has enabled me to improve
the categorization and ranking algorithms. I'm at a point now where I 
feel I need a lot more sources than the ~4000 I have right now, as well as
more categories. The latter is more complex and will take me back to some
of my earlier explorations in clustering, etc. The former largely involves 
mining more of the web to find useful sites.</p>
<p>Currently doing a pull of the ~4000 sites takes several minutes on my 
low-power server. If I want to scale to 10x or more polling is not ideal.
So another change I have needed is to move to a push model. Thankfully
that's possible, through the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubSubHubbub">PubSubHubbub</a> (aka PuSH). This is a Google-designed 
system whereby publishers can 
push notifications of updates to central servers that in turn support
subscriptions on clients for receiving notifications. There are commercial 
services for this (<a href="http://superfeedr.com">Superfeedr</a> seem's to be the main
player here) but there is also a publicly accessible server run by Google.</p>
<p>Using this is fairly straightforward. Here is a simple Python script for
subscribing or unsubscribing. You pass in a command (subscribe/unsubscribe), an
RSS feed URL you want notfications for, and a callback URL that the PuSH
server will call back to, both to confirm the subscription and to send
notifications to:</p>

<p>You can include a verification token too in the params, and your callback
server can verify that to make sure that you did the subscribe request and 
not someone else.</p>
<p>The other part of this is the callback server. In my case I want to just fold
this in to my node server, so I added this code in my routes/index.js file. For
now I'm just writing the updates to a file. My callback URL is hostname/pubsub:</p>

<p>Well, I hope you've all brushed your teeth after all that Halloween candy.</p>
<p>Today I'm going to show how I build a simple web server to view my feed
articles using node.js and Express, along with MongoDB. I have a simple 
category classifier which finds the best Jacard similarity (described earlier)
to a set of category exemplars (i.e. 'pseudo-articles' for a category
containing just key words that are typical for that category). It needs a
lot of tuning and the earlier tkInter program was meant for that but tkInter 
proved to have problems. So time to use some more modern techologies!</p>
<p>I gave an overview of node in an earlier article; if you have no familiarity
with node you should go read that first. I'm not going to go into 
much detail here about installation, etc; if you want to try this you can 
easily install node for your platform. We're going to generate a scaffold 
Express app with a generator, so we need to install that along with its
dependencies:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>npm install -g express-generator
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>and then generate the skeleton in a 'server' subdirectory:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>express server
<span class="nb">cd</span> server
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>This skeleton will include a package.json file; we need to edit that and
add these to the end of the dependencies section (make sure to add a comma
on the previous last line in the dependencies):</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="s2">"mongodb"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">"~2.0.33"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="s2">"monk"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">"~1.0.1"</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>Then install the dependencies:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> server
npm install
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>Although we'll be adding some more and need to rerun this again later.</p>
<p>We need to tell node to use our database. To do that, we edit app.js
and before the line that says:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td>

<p>we add:</p>

<p>(I called my MongoDB feed_database; you would need to use a different name
for a different database).</p>
<p>To make the database accessible to our page handler, before the line that says:</p>

<p>we add:</p>

<span class="p">});</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>This will add a property 'db' to each request that points to out database so
each request handler has easy access to the database.</p>
<p>Our server will use the local URL /categories for a page with the 
list of categories that have articles. Each of these will in turn link
to an /articles page which will show the titles of articles for that
category, and link back to the source. To set up the routes we need to edit
routes/index.js, and add our additions (before the modules.exports
line at the end):</p>

<p>The /categories page router finds all distinct values for the 'classification'
field (which I use to put my categorization of an article, as they already
have a 'Category' field which is part of RSS). It then renders a page using
a 'categories' template and passes the template an object with a 'categories'
property which has the resulting document returned by the database. The
template engine is Jade which Express uses by default.</p>
<p>We'll look at the /article page route in a moment; first look at the 
template for the categories page which we create in file views/categories.jade:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>extends layout

block content
  h1.
    Categories
  ul
    each category in categories
      li
        a(href="articles?category=#{category}")= category
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>This is pretty simple. Jade uses indentation for hierarchy so that is important
to get correct. We create a heading and a list, with each list entry
being a category name in the form of a link to the /articles page with a 
query parameter for the category. Now the /articles router should be easy
to understand. We find all documents in the database that have the same
classification as was specified in the category query parameter in the request
URL, and render the page using the article template, passing that template
the article list and category name. That template looks like:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>extends layout

block content
  h1.
    Articles for #{category}
  ul
    each article in articles
      li
        a(href="#{article.link}")= article.title
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>Very similar to the category one except we put article titles in the list and
our links refer to the original article links, so clicking on a title will
take us to the web page for that article. Pretty simple!</p>
<p>Now we can run this:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>npm start
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>and navigate to http://localhost:3000/categories to see what we might want to
read!</p>

<p>Happy Halloween, all!</p>
<p>I'm sitting here handing out candy and glow necklaces to all comers so its a
good time to write a new post.</p>
<p>It's been a while since much happened as I've been really busy with the beta 
release of Google Cloud Datalab, which is my day job. But now that is out and
it's the weekend and lousy weather here in the Pacific Northwest it's been a 
good day t get back to things.</p>
<p>Today I did something I've been meaning to do for a while, which is to change
the code to populate a MongoDB database rather than writing files to the file 
system. Interestingly it seems to be quite a bit slower than the file system 
but hopefully it will scale better and make up for things when I have ad-hoc
queries to do.</p>
<p>I hadn't used MongoDB before so it was a learning opportunity. Mongo is a 
no-SQL database that stores <em>collections</em> of <em>documents</em> in its databases,
rather than tables of records, so it is well suited
to storing the JSON RSS feed objects. It's very easy to use too. I modified
my exitisting code to take two callbacks, one to create an ID from an article, 
and the other to save the article give the ID. For the old code, the ID just
corresponds to the pathname of the file, and saving just saves the JSON as a
string to that file. The ID creator has a secondary role of checking if we have
already fetched that object before, in which case we don't need to save it.</p>
<p>Each document has a special unique key '_id', and can have secondary keys. The
document itself is an ordered set of keys with associated values (which can
themselves be documents), so this maps reasonably well to Javascript objects.
Keys are any UTF-8 strings but should avoid '$' and '.' which have special 
usage, and NUL which is used as a key terminator. Keys must be unique, and are case sensitive.</p>
<p>Collections (groups of documents) can store different types of documents; they do
not have a fixed schema. That said, it is generally more sensible and efficient
to keep similar documents in the same collection, and make use of multiple 
collections, rather than putting everything in one collection. Collection names
are non-empty UTF-8 strings that don't include NUL or '$' and don't start with 
'system.' (the latter two constraints are for implementation-specific reasons).</p>
<p>Database names should be non-empty alphanumeric ASCII strings of 64 bytes or less 
(not actually quite that restrictive but that's a good guideline). 'admin' is a
special root database, and 'config' is a special database that stores sharding 
information. 'local' is a database that can be used to store collections that should
not be replicated.</p>
<p>I now have an articles collection, and my
callbacks to use Mongo just look like this:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>

<p>Very simple, no? But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself; it's worth mentioning 
how I installed Mongo. You can download it from mongodb.org. I went for 
version 2.6 rather than 3 as there is a nice free GUI tool for inspecting 
and querying the database called RoboMongo and it doesn't work yet with Mongo 3.</p>
<p>If you download the Mac version of Mongo you get compiled binaries, not an
installer. These need to be put in your path somewhere. I use Homebrew for 
some software on the Mac so I already have a /usr/local/bin directory in
my path, and just put the Mongo files there. I know, this is polluting the
Homebrew install somewhat, but it seemed the most practical anyway. You then
need to create a directory for the databases, which by default on the Mac should
be /data/db. Make sure you have write permission, or at least the user account
that is going to run the mongo server does. You can then start Mongo by running
'mongod' at the command line.</p>
<p>Mongo creates databases and collections when they are accessed which makes 
things very simple. The initial code in my fetcher looks like this:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre> 1

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Things have been slow on the blogging front but there has been progress on the
Zite replacement. I'll write more about that soon but part of what I have been 
doing is looking into what server-side technology to use.</p>
<p>As far as a database goes, this seems like a no-brainer. I'm dealing with JSON
documents that I can either spend some effort on normalizing to put into a SQL 
database, or simply keep them as is and put them in a database that supports 
that form, and the obvious choice then is <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, 
which uses a binary form of JSON.</p>
<p>As for what to use to handle network requests, there I am torn between
<a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">Tornado</a>
(which is Python) and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> (Javascript). I'm not 
a big fan of Javascript 
(despite having implemented Javascript compilers and virtual machines twice in 
my life!), primarily because it relies too much on sneaky tricks to do things
like encapsulation and OOP, but it certainly is the closest to a first-class
language for MongoDB, so I'm doing the investigation. I've had a small amount
of exposure to Node.js at work but mostly as a user, not developer, so what
follows are some of my initial notes on the topic of Node.js, the npm package
manager, and the Express web framework. I hope you find them useful if these
are new to you.</p>
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p>Node is a version of Chrome's v8 Javascript engine 
which includes a set of useful packages for server-side code (event-driven networking, 
file system etc) and a package manager, npm. Node was motivated by the need to handle 
large numbers of simultaneous sockets for HTTP long polling and web sockets; using 
separate threads or processes for each socket is too costly in resources (especially 
memory). Instead it uses the JS event loop and closure callbacks to scale efficiently.
 The underlying non-blocking socket code is written in C and wrapped in JS.</p>
<h2>CommonJS</h2>
<p>CommonJS is a suite of standardized APIs for using Javascript on the server,
addresses namespacing among other things. For the latter it includes three key
components:</p>
<ul>
<li>require() method used to load a module</li>
<li>exports object to expose code</li>
<li>module object</li>
</ul>
<p>Each module is a single JS file with isolated scope overridden by the exports object. 
E.g. consider a file hello.js:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Hello'</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">exports</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sayHello</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">message</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>which can then be used like:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">hello</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'./hello'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sayHello</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>Alternatively we could have written:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">exports</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Hello'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>and used:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">hello</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'./hello'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h2>Node core modules</h2>
<p>Core modules are compiled into the node binary, and include 'fs' for file
system access, and 'http' for network support. They still need to be loaded
with require(). See <a href="http://nodejs.org/api">http://nodejs.org/api/</a> 
for more about the core modules.</p>
<h2>npm - The node package manager</h2>
<p>npm can install packages and their dependencies locally (in ./node_modules)
or globally with the -g option (in /usr/local/lib/node_modules). You would
typically install common build tools like grunt globally, and dependencies
for a project locally. </p>
<p>Note that dependencies are not installed at the top-level but within the
package directory. So if you do 'npm install express' then express's
dependencies will be installed in ./node_modules/express/node_modules directory.</p>
<p>You can specify package@version if you need a specific version. See
<a href="https://github/com/isaacs/node-semver">https://github/com/isaacs/node-semver</a>
for details on semantic versioning names.</p>
<p>Use 'npm uninstall' to remove a package (include -g for global packages), and 
'npm update' to update a package.</p>
<p>For multiple packages use a package.json file, with (at least) "name", "version"
 and "dependencies" entries. Use "npm init" to create a skeleton package.json.
 Then use "npm install"/"npm update" to install/update all dependencies specified 
 in the file. You can use "npm install <package> —save" to install a new package 
 and add it to package.json at the same time.</package></p>
<p>To use modules, use require(). If you just specify a name, node will first look 
in the core modules folder, then the node_modules/module folder. Alternatively 
you can specify an absolute or relative path (the .js extension is not needed). 
You can load an entire folder with a single require() if that folder has a 
package.json file (the "main" module will be returned from require()).</p>
<h2>The Connect module</h2>
<p>The Connect module builds on top of the http module, and allows the chaining of 
request handlers (e.g. for logging, static file handling, etc). Each handler 
has three arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>req - the request object</li>
<li>res - the response object</li>
<li>next - the next handler in the chain</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a simple server:</p>

<li>moving from IPython notebook to a library that I can use to do batch operations as well as interactive exploration modifying the code do do parallel fetches - or more precisely, to operate asynchronously; because of the Python GIL I still have just one thread for now. But I can kick off up to 40 HTTP requests at a time which speeds things up a lot, as I have about 4000 sites I'm working with now;</li>
<li>exploring the <a href="http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/">TextBlob library</a>, a library that sits above the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">Python NLTK</a> and can parse sentences and words (more on that below)</li>
<li>building a GUI application with <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter">Tkinter</a> that lets me quickly view feeds, terms, categories and articles, delete feeds, tweak category examplars and see the results, and so on. This has been invaluable in building up and fine tuning my category examplars, although it is still a work in progress. It's been somewhat painful as I haven't used Tk in about two decades but I've mostly got it to do what I want.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see a screenshot of the GUI below to get an idea of what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="images/feedme_screenshot.png"><img alt="feedme app screenshot" src="images/feedme_screenshot.png" title="feedme app screenshot"></a></p>
<p>This is meant just for my use so its functional rather than polished.</p>
<p>The TextBlob library is worth investigating if you are considering doing anything like this. In the end I abandoned it because the code I have written for parsing sentences and words is almost as good and about an order of magnitude faster. But I will show the code I experimented with so you can see how easy it is to use. Below is the code for getting the term counts for an article downloaded with feedparser. Note that I still handle correcting the capitalization of initial words in sentences, and I use my own logic for extracting noun phrases; TextBlob has code for that but it is seemingly not very good. The key thing is to note that I don't have to do much at all to get at sentences and then at words within sentences:</p>

<p>The next step for me is to start using my category examplars to categorize new articles on a daily basis so I have a manageable quantity I can sanity check. With a bit more tuning I want to build a simple web front end to this so I can open it up for others to try and provide feedback. Watch this space!</p>

<p>I then modified the code that reads in the articles file and calculates the TF-IDF similarity matrix to first read this file (categories.txt) so that these become the first 4 articles, then I recomputed the matrix.</p>

<p>The results are show below although I shortened it to 10 for brevity. As you can see we have good category classification. Obviously though there is a long way to go in adding more category records. One benefit of this approach is that unlike clustering, an item can occur in the top n list for multiple categories, which is desirable.</p>

<p>In summary, we can now take articles, extract a set of key terms, and assign them to one or more categories. There is obviously work to be done, tuning the categories over time and adding many more. One way to determine how to adjust the key terms for existing categories is to look at the top terms across all articles assigned to that category, and add them to the category terms if they aren't already present.</p>
<p>I'll probably be busy with this for a few days but once I have a good working system the next topic will be ranking. Ranking will work best in conjunction with crowdsourcing so I may need to build the system out as far as a simple web front end that can be used as a categorical RSS search engine. Watch this space for future developments!</p>

<p>My initial experience with clustering was somewhat disappointing. Its clear I need to do some tuning of the approach. The first thing I did was to rerun the article download process, but instead of just keeping the top ten terms and dropping their TF-IDF values, I kept them all. I think there are better ways to select the terms to use for Jacard similarity.</p>
<p>For starters, using a fixed number of terms could lead to keeping a wildly different range of TF-IDF values for different articles. It makes more sense to have some threshold value and keep all terms that exceed the threshold. That may mean more than ten terms for some articles and less for others.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is not much point in keeping terms that only appear in a single article. That term may be useful if we search articles based on terms, but it will not help much in computing Jacard distances. Some caution is needed here - dropping these terms does reduce the size of the term set and thus will reduce the union with any other article's term set, thus boosting the similarity that the first article has with all other articles. But as this gets boosted across the board, I don't expect it to be much of an issue.</p>
<p>Finally, it may not be a bad idea to create some 'fake' term sets that can act as cluster centroids. I.e. for some topic, create a term set of terms that are particularly relevant and if possible unique to that topic. Using these as centroids we could simply assign each article to the closest centroid which is a straightforward task. Furthermore, we don't have to compute the $n ^ 2$ matrix of distances; if we have $m$ centroids we need only compute $n \times m$ distances, and if $m$ is fixed we essentially have a linear scaling approach.</p>
<p>In order to do this, it is a reasonable idea to take the full set of terms that occur at least $k$ times for some chosen value $k$, assign each of these terms one or more topics, and then pivot that so each topic has a set of terms, which becomes a pseudo-article and the centroid for that topic.</p>
<p>Below is the code I am now using to get the articles:</p>

<p>The top terms I got out of this are 'is' and 'are', so its clear that the top_words list could do with some more stop words, but that doesn't really matter. I put together a new list of about 700 stop words I will use in future, and filter those out below:</p>

<p>That still leaves me with about 50,000 terms, with about 25% of that being terms that occur 4 or 5 times only. There are some interesting terms in there but clearly it would be costly to deal with that many. Sticking with capitalized terms cuts things down to about 15000. This would still be a lot of work to categorize so I think its time to take a different tack and try using gensim. My hope is that gensim can do better clustering than I got with affinity propagation and I can use the results to in turn extract the initial category term sets. Let's see what it can do. The code below will use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to cluster the articles into 200 clusters. First we need to turn our articles into term lists expanded out by term count (so if 'recipe' appears four times we need to make four copies; it is unfortunate that gensim will turn that back into a bag but doesn't seem to be able to take an existing bag as input).</p>

<p>It takes a few minutes to run but its worth it! The result is a set of vectors that give the the most important words and their weights for the cluster. A lot of these don't make sense but quite a number do - certainly enough to give the centroid articles I need. For example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>u'0.060*cup + 0.055*kitchen + 0.039*sugar + 0.038*baking + 0.034*size + 0.034*milk + 0.031*recipe
 + 0.030*cheese + 0.026*dough + 0.025*bread'
</pre>


<p>gives a set of important words for cooking/recipes category, while:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>u'0.273*God + 0.050*playing + 0.038*exercise + 0.030*Bible + 0.025*religion + 0.023*argument +
 0.020*prayer + 0.016*religious + 0.016*claims + 0.014*mercy',
</pre>


<p>gives some for religion. I may need more than 200 clusters but this is a good start. More to come!</p>

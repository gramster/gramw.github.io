<article class="post post"><header class="post-header"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="posts/last-day-on-live-search-for-mobile.html">Last Day on Live Search for Mobile</a></h2>
    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Today is my last official day on the Live Search for Mobile team. I am
moving over to a new team working on some incubating new mobile
initiatives in emerging markets (as a South African ex-pat I can relate
to this). It has been a fun ride and it is hard to let go of the Windows
Mobile client which I think of as 'my baby' (with co-parent Ashley).
There is still so much to do. However, some of the things that I have
been trying to get shipped since September 2006 are finally going out
the door in the upcoming release so I can feel that I have achieved at
least some of what I set out to do.</p>
<p>I'll continue blogging here of course, and I expect to blog quite a lot
about the new release once it is out.</p>
<p>We started the WM client team in July 2006, after the MOJAX (mobile
AJAX) project got killed. That left the core group - the Barrel of
Monkeys - without a home. There were five of us - Steve (PM), Ashley and
I (dev), John (test) and Danny (architect). Rather than each go off to
different jobs we decided to try stick together, and managed to find a
home in local search. We had three months to get the v1.0 product out,
and it was a hit! We got an awful lot of fan mail from that (and if you
were a sender, thanks! We've always appreciated the love :-) ).

<p>We get gas price data from a 3rd party provider. They in turn get the
data from credit card companies. ARCO does not accept credit cards.</p>
<p>This is a great example of where user-contributed data would be
valuable, and I hope that one day we will be able to extend the feature
to include that.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I have had all the PCs in our house on Vista since Vista RTMed. This
includes my kids computers, and I like the Vista parental controls
(although I wish they were more comprehensive, combining not only
allowed hours of use but quotas as well). I recently wanted to run my
old copy of the game Creatures, and could not get it to install on
Vista. This was sufficiently frustrating that I decided to switch one PC
back to XP. With all the stories in the blogosphere of people
"upgrading" to XP I thought it would be an interesting contrast to go
back.

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>I just wanted to share this information that one of our Blackberry devs,
Didier, sent to a customer who was having problems as it may be useful
to others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since Live Search for BlackBerry is distributed as an independent
third party application, it works only if such applications are
allowed to do network requests, which may depend on both your carrier
network policies and your subscription type.</p>
<p>We support three connection modes in Live Search for BlackBerry:
Direct HTTP, BES/MDS and WAP Gateway, but for CDMA devices only Direct
HTTP and BES/MDS are possible (WAP is specific to GPRS/Edge carriers).
BES/MDS is for corporate devices administrated through the company’s
BlackBerry Enterprise Server, Direct HTTP is for individual
subscribers. You can try both modes if you are unsure of your
configuration (in Options &gt; Enter your network configuration
parameters).</p>
<p>But some BlackBerry data plans may be limited to Email &amp; Web browsing
and Live Search will not work in this case.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>My daughter bought a Webkinz today. These are cheap stuffed animals that
sell at a premium because they have a 'secret code' that allow you to
access the Webkinz website and play games, etc. So of course she wanted
me to set her up to access the site (her PC was locked down to only
allow access to PBS Kids).</p>
<p>We go to the site, sign her up, and then sign in. This launches a new
window running an Adobe Flash app. The URL is not even tied to a domain,
but uses a numeric IP address. After watching it flash 'Loading' for a
while, we get a picture of a green field - and nothing happens.
Meanwhile my wife starts complaining from upstairs that the network has
slowed to a total crawl; not only can't she browse but even the LAN is
pretty hosed, with Outlook frozen up while trying to send an e-mail to
the local Exchange server in the next room.

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>My wife has been bugging me to make it easier for her to use our scanner
and printer to make copies. I could buy a cheap all-in-one but she
actually needs laser copies, not inkjet, for her hobby of stamp carving
(she can iron a laser-printed image to make a basic transfer). The
scanner and printer are attached to my PC but she wants to make copies
without having to log on to my PC or bother me.</p>
<p>I believe that HP scanners can do this, but I have an Epson Perfection
4490, and if you press the 'Scan to Printer' button on the front it pops
up UI on the PC. It's definitely not a one-step process and the buttons
are a bit of a joke. So I thought I'd write my own app using Window
Image Acquisition to do this. My original plan was to write something
that hooked the button event and then slept in the notification tray,
waking up when the button gets pressed.

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>We often get asked why we don't have a menu item in the Contacts app on
the phone to map a contact, but Google does. The comments can sometimes
be quite disparaging (like what's wrong with you people in Redmond,
anyway?). So here is the tale, told by an idiot, without much sound or
fury.</p>
<p>Early in 2006 I wrote the code to hook into Contacts. It worked pretty
well, and we planned to ship this in our v2 release in July '07. Shortly
before our release date, Google released an update to their Windows
Mobile map app, and they had the feature. So we immediately decided to
test to make sure we played nicely together.

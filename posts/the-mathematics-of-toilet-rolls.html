<p>In the late 1980s I was contracted to write some software for a company
that produced video-based educational systems. They had video cassette
machines that had been modified to interface with a PC, which could send
instructions to the VCRs such as play, stop, fast forward, and rewind.
The educational programs consisted of short recorded segments which
typically ended with a question, and based on the answer the user
provided they wanted to continue play at different portions of the tape.
The software they wanted me to write was meant to be able to be given a
current position (i.e. play time) and advance to a new position. For
example I might be told that they are at minute 8 currently and want to
resume play at minute 12.</p>

<p>Without going into all the detail, I can tell you this was a Very Hard
Problem. There was no way to tell where you were on the tape without
actually playing, and if you are familiar with VCRs (which are rapidly
going the way of the dinosaur) you may be aware that engaging the play
head takes a few seconds. There were variations in motor speed, tape
stretching, and all sorts of other variables to take into account. The
approach I used was to try to calculate the “optimal” fast forward time,
shorten that a bit, and then narrow down to the exact position with a
modified binary search (or, to put it more crudely, “trial and error”).</p>
<p>We got the system to work although it was a pretty crude affair but
before anything shipped new VCRs came out that recorded “time code” on
the tape and had much more precise electronics essentially supporting
just this functionality we had duct-taped together, and so it was all
for naught (and not long after CD-ROMs came and made it all redundant
anyway).</p>
<p>I don’t remember all the math that I worked out for this system, but it
is easy enough to recall the basic parameters. There was the diameter of
the empty plastic spools, the diameter of a full spool, and the playing
time of the tape (typically 120 minutes), which was a linear function of
the length (assuming an unstretched tape :-))</p>
<p>While playback happened at a constant speed, as the tape ran through an
independent roller mechanism unaffected by the spool state,
fast-forwarding and rewinding happened at a variable rate, as it was
controlled by the motors driving the spool, and the spool diameters
changed.</p>

<p>All in all, a nasty business, and we are better off without tape! But
there is still a common household item with some similar
characteristics, namely the toilet roll. So, here are some problems
surrounding toilet rolls to think about. To save you having to measure
your toilet rolls here are some typical measurements from mine (Charmin
2 ply from Costco) - spool diameter 45mm, roll diameter 120mm, 250 x
101mm sheets = 25250mm length.</p>
<ul>
<li>how thick is each sheet of paper? (and thus, how many times does it
    go around the spool?)</li>
<li>what would the diameter of a roll be that went all the way around
    the earth (assuming the earth’s diameter is 12,756.32km)?</li>
<li>what if it went around the earth but 1m higher than in the example
    before? How long would the roll be? (you may recognize this as a
    familiar puzzle involving rope but I thought I’d sneak it in here!)</li>
</ul>
<p>(BTW no less a figure than Donald Knuth has considered toilet paper
worthy of investigation, as evidenced
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2322567">here</a>).</p>
<p>If we call the paper thickness \(t\), the radius of the
spool \(r_s\) and the radius of the roll (spool plus paper) \(r_r\),
then it should be obvious that the number of winds \(n\)
is:</p>
<p>$$n = \frac{r_r - r_s}{t}$$</p>
<p>If we approximate the roll as a number of concentric circles rather than
a spiral, then the innermost roll has length \(2\pi r_s\), and
the next roll has length \(2\pi (r_s+t)\), and so on; each
successive roll is \(2\pi t\) longer than the prior one, and the
final roll has length \(2\pi r_r\).</p>
<p>Because each successive roll is longer by a constant amount, we have an
arithmetic sequence. Recall that the sum of an arithmetic sequence is
given by \(\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)\), where \(n\) is the
number of terms, \(a_1\) is the first term, and \(a_n\) is
the last term. So the length of the entire roll is given by:</p>
<p>$$l = \frac{n}{2} ( 2\pi r_s + 2 \pi r_r) = \pi \frac{r_r^2 - r_s^2}{t}$$</p>
<p>Thus my toilet paper is about 0.38 mm thick - quite luxurious!</p>
<p>For the second problem it is reasonable to assume \(r_s = 0\), to
give us the simpler formula:</p>
<p>$$l \approx \pi \frac{r_r^2}{t}$$</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>$$r_r \approx \sqrt{\frac{l t}{\pi}}$$</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>$$r_r \approx \sqrt{d t}$$</p>
<p>where \(d\) is the earth’s diameter. So for my paper this would be
about 70 meters. If I had a cheaper brand of one ply paper this might be
considerably less.</p>
<p>I’ll leave the last question as an exercise but it should be fairly
clear that the difference in \(l\) in this case is quite small and
so the extra radius needed for the toilet roll is very small.</p>

    "\n",
    "There are many different models of personality types, but one used in psychology and psychoanalysis is the categorization in the [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This is a [somewhat controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders&section=15#Criticism) publication that categorizes a number of maladaptive personality categories, and there are schools of thought in psychoanalysis who use similar categories in adaptive forms to describe similar personality types in less extreme forms; the most common forms here are captured in the [Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamic_Diagnostic_Manual#Dimension_I:_Personality_Patterns_and_Disorders).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're treading on some slippery ground here, but as long as you consider this just a model it can offer some insight.\n",

    "\n",
    "Individuals with depressive personalities may be highly self-critical or selfpunitive,\n",
    "holding themselves to unrealistic standards and blaming themselves when\n",
    "things go wrong. They may fear rejection or abandonment, feel alone even in the\n",
    "presence of others, or have a pervasive sense that someone or something necessary for\n",
    "their well-being has been lost to them forever. Individuals with depressive personalities\n",
    "are often unaware of underlying anger and hostility. Depression, self-criticism, or selfpunitiveness\n",
    "often defend against an awareness of underlying aggression (for further\n",
    "description, see Westen et al., 2012).\n",
    "Individuals with depressive personalities may or may not experience depressive\n",
    "mood states that reach the intensity of a diagnosable mood disorder. In addition, not\n",
    "all individuals who are chronically vulnerable to depressive symptoms have depressive\n",
    "personalities, organized around the motifs outlined above. Research has made it clear\n",
    "that there are multiple personality pathways to depression as a symptom syndrome\n",

    "\n",
    "*dependent - submissive and clinging\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people come to therapy because their personalities are characterized centrally by\n",
    "excessive dependency needs. Because individuals with severely dependent psychologies\n",
    "may find themselves unable to leave relationships that are exploitive or even abusive,\n",
    "such phenomena have sometimes been called “self-defeating” or “masochistic” (see\n",
    "the previous discussion of masochistic dynamics). The categories of “inadequate” and\n",
    "“infantile” personality in earlier taxonomies connote roughly the same construct as\n",
    "our use of the term “dependent personality.”\n",
    "Individuals who are characterologically overdependent are found at all levels of\n",
    "severity. They define themselves mainly in relation to others, and seek security and\n",
    "satisfaction predominantly in interpersonal contexts (“I am fine as long as everything\n",
    "is OK with my husband”). Psychological symptoms may appear when something\n",
    "goes wrong in a primary attachment relationship. At the neurotic level, people with\n",
    "dependent personality may seek treatment in midlife or later, after a bereavement or\n",
    "divorce, or after retirement confronts them with the absence of a context in which\n",
    "rules and expectations are clear. At the borderline and psychotic levels, dependent\n",
    "patients may become dysregulated when expected to depend on their own resources\n",
    "and may use costly defenses, such as somatization and acting out, in desperate bids\n",
    "to elicit care.\n",
    "Overly dependent individuals may feel ineffectual when left to themselves. They\n",
    "tend to regard others as powerful and effective. Organizing their lives with a view\n",
    "to maintaining nurturing relationships in which they are submissive, they may feel\n",
    "contented when they have successfully developed such a relationship and acutely distressed\n",
    "when they have not. Emotional preoccupations include performance anxiety\n",
    "and fears of criticism and abandonment (Bornstein, 1993). People with dependent personalities\n",
    "tend to feel weak and powerless, to be passive and nonassertive, and to be\n",
    "easily influenced by others. They often appear naive. They may feel worthless and have\n",
    "difficulties in expressing anger. In therapy, which they may enter readily, they may be\n",
    "compliant to a fault. They tend to idealize their therapists, ask for advice, and seek\n",
    "reassurances that they are “good patients.” In attempts to become special, they may\n",

    "threatening emotions and desires through rigidity, regimentation, and intellectualization.\n",
    "They tend to be excessively concerned with rules, procedures, order, organization,\n",
    "schedules, and so on, and may be excessively devoted to work and “productivity”\n",
    "to the detriment of leisure and relationships. They rely on intellectualization as a\n",
    "defense and tend to see themselves as logical and rational, uninfluenced by emotion.\n",
    "Asked how they feel, they are likely to describe what they think. They tend to think\n",
    "in abstractions or become preoccupied with details. Beneath an “orderly” and regimented\n",
    "exterior, they are preoccupied with underlying issues of control, and caught\n",
    "in an unconscious conflict between feeling that they must submit to others’ demands\n",
    "(which elicits rage and shame) or rebel and defy them (which elicits anxiety and fear\n",

    "\n",
    "Schizoid individuals are often seen as loners and tend to be more comfortable by\n",
    "themselves than with others. At the same time, they may feel a deep yearning for closeness\n",
    "and have elaborate fantasies about emotional and sexual intimacy (Doidge, 2001;\n",
    "Guntrip, 1969; Seinfeld, 1991). They can be startlingly aware of features of their inner\n",

    "\n",

    "weakness, defectiveness, or fearfulness, and to gain a sense of power or conquest over\n",
    "the exciting (but envied and frightening) opposite sex. Sexual intimacy, however, is\n",
    "a source of conflict because of unconscious shame about one’s gendered body and\n",
    "fears of being damaged by the more powerful other. People with hysteric–histrionic\n",

    "extracting such affirmation in the form of status, admiration, wealth, or success may\n",
    "feel an internal elation, behave in a grandiose and arrogant manner, evince a sense\n",
    "of entitlement, and treat others (especially those perceived as of lower status) with\n",
    "contempt. When the environment fails to provide such evidence, narcissistic individuals\n",
    "may feel depressed, ashamed, and envious of those who succeed in attaining the\n",

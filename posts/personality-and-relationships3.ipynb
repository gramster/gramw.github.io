    "It's been a while since the [last post](/posts/personality-and-relationships2.html) in this series where I discussed personality types. I started a new job in the summer and that has been keeping me busy. But I've long wanted to get back to this series so here goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post I want to discuss two things: how the five factors relate to the personality types, and how psychologists can assess personality without doing personality tests, but by making use of an awareness of _counter-transference_ - how they _feel_ in the presence of the subject/client. If we try to assess the personality of others, knowing these can be useful; after all, we're not going to get them to take 200+ question personality assessment tests! :-)\n",

    "Freud identified counter-transference around 1910 as \"the result of the patient's influence on \\[the therapist's\\] unconscious feelings\". He saw it as something that thereapists needed to be aware of and overcome. Over time this understanding was expanded, so it became clear that counter-transference reflected the personalities of both the therapist and the patient. If these could be teased apart, then it was the former that needed to be overcome (_personal counter-transference_), but the latter (_diagnostic counter-transference_) would actually be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if diagnostic counter-transference useful, what can it tell us about assessing the personality of others? I have seen limited research in this area despite it seeming to be very useful. The main study I have found is [Patient Personality and Therapist\n",
    "Response: An Empirical Investigation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3b6e/20332a61cb3c924dec135c1f0823781b57aa.pdf), and this doesn't seem to take personal counter-transference into consideration. Furthermore, the research is on counter-transference to personality _disorders_; that is, on maladaptive forms of the personality types.\n",

    "However, assuming a somewhat impartial assessor, these are some of the results that have been observed:\n",

    "| Engaged, protective, nurturing | Dependent |\n",
    "\n",
    "The main other source for this I have seen is the book \"Psychoanalytic Diagnosis\" by Nancy McWilliams. She discusses both transference and counter-transference for different types, as summarised below (my interpretation of her text). \"Transference\" is the patient's reaction to the therapist. Some of these may sound contradictory, but take for example transference in schizoid patients: they are unused to social closeness and having to open up to a therapist can generate fear and anxiety, but at the same time they are appreciative of the therapists care and concern. If the patient feels threatened by the therapist they may withdraw leading to counterdetachment in the therapist, but if the therapist can gain their trust the therapist can feel warm and appreciated, hence gratitude.\n",

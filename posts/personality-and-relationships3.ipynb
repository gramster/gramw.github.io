    "In this post I want to discuss two things: how the five factors relate to the personality types, and how psychologists can assess personality without doing personality tests, but by making use of an awareness of _counter-transference_ - how they _feel_ in the presence of the subject/client.\n",

The research I have seen does not take this into account. It would be more accurate for this to be a matrix combining the personality of the assessor and the assessed. Furthermore, the research is mostly done on personality _disorders_; that is, on maladaptive forms of the personality types.\n",

<p>In the Indian city of Benares, beneath a dome that marks the center of
the world, is a brass plate in which are set three diamond needles, each
as thick as a bee and a cubit high. At the time of creation Brahma
placed on one of these needles 64 disks of pure gold, each a different
size, each resting only on plates of a larger size (so the largest disk
was at the bottom and the smallest at the top).</p>
<p>In the temple are priests whose task is to transfer all the disks to a
different needle, moving only one disk at a time between needles but
never placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one. When the task is
done, tower, temple and Brahmins all will vanish with a thunderclap and
the world will vanish.</p>
<p>So how much time do we have left?
<!-- TEASER_END --></p>
<p>The romantic fable above was popularized (and possibly invented) by one
Edouard Lucas to accompany a popular game he invented and sold in 1883,
called the Towers of Hanoi. The game itself has only 8 disks (which is
fortunate, as we shall see), and is still available today.</p>
<p><img alt="An original Edouard Lucas puzzle. Photo courtesy of the Puzzle Museum.  (C)2009 Hordern-Dalgety Collection &lt;http://puzzlemuseum.org&gt;)" src="../images/200703_hanoi_1st_lab_375.jpg"></p>
<p>When trying to solve the problem, it helps to start small. Obviously if
there were no discs, no moves would be needed, and with one disc, just
one move is needed. What about two discs? That would require three
moves: moving the smallest disc from the “initial” to the “spare”
needle, then moving the largest disc to the “target” needles, and
finally moving the small disc to the target needle.</p>
<p>Going beyond two discs things are a little less obvious. If we think
about the largest disc though, we can note that in order to move the
largest disc from the initial to the target pin, we must first move all
the other discs to the spare pin. So, if we have <em>n</em> discs, we can state
a solution to the <em>n</em>-disc problem thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>move <em>n-1</em> discs from the initial to the spare needle, using the
target needle as a spare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>move disc <em>n</em> (the largest disc) from the initial needle to the target
needle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>move <em>n-1</em> discs from the spare needle to the target needle, using the
initial needle as a spare</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have effectively reduced the n disc problem to an <em>n-1</em> disc
problem. If we repeatedly apply this approach, eventually we get to a 1
disc problem which is trivial.</p>
<p>Even though we have “solved” the problem, it is not obvious what the
sequence of moves should be for a large number of discs. Nonetheless,
the method above works, and describes a formal recipe, commonly known as
an <strong><em>algorithm</em></strong>, to solve the problem. Keeping track of the sequence
of moves that have been done and still need to be done can be somewhat
tedious for a human, but not for a computer, and the method above is
often used in computer programs to solve the Towers problem. The
algorithm could be written as:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>SolveTowers(from, to, using, n)
{
    if (n &gt; 0)
    {
        SolveTowers(from, using, to, n-1);
        print "Move disc " + n + " from needle "+from+" to needle "+to;
        SolveTowers(using, to, from, n-1);
    }
}
</pre>


<p>If we called the needles A, B and C, and ran the algorithm above with
“SolveTowers(A, B, C, 64)” we would get the sequence of moves needed by
the monks. Algorithms like the one above, where we break the problem
down using a smaller version of itself, are called <strong><em>recursive
algorithms</em></strong>.</p>
<p>We still haven’t answered the question of how long it would take, but
we’re getting closer. If we call the number of moves needed to solve the
<em>n</em>-disc Tower problem \(S_{n}\), then we can see (modeling the
steps above):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we need \(S_{n-1}\) moves for the first step</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plus one move for disc n</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plus \(S_{n-1}\) moves for the last step</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words \(S_{n} = 2 S_{n-1} + 1\).</p>
<p>This  equation needs to stop somewhere to be useful; we know that one
disc takes one move so we know that \(S_{1} = 1\). So we can write
the complete recursive definition of \(S_{n}\) as:</p>
<p>$$ S_n = \begin{cases} 
2S_{n-1} + 1 &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1, \\
1 &amp; \text{if } n = 1. 
\end{cases} $$</p>
<p>Equations like this, where we define sequence terms in terms of earlier
sequence terms, are called <strong><em>recurrence</em>* </strong>relations<strong><em> or
</em></strong>difference equations<strong><em>, while known values like \(S_{1} = 1\)
that terminate the process are called </em></strong>boundary conditions***.</p>
<p>Towers of Hanoi is just one of many recurrence relations. We’ll look at
a few more and then look at some general techniques for dealing with
these.</p>
<p>For a first example, consider how many pieces you can slice the plane
into with a number of lines, where no two lines are parallel and no
three intersect at a single point (lines that satisfy these conditions
are said to be in <em>general position</em>). The first line will divide the
plane in two; the second line will divide it in four, the third in
seven, and in general:</p>
<p>$$P_n = P_{n-1} + n$$</p>
<p>where \(P_n\) is the number of pieces after the n’th line. I.e.
the \(n^{th}\) line adds \(n\) new pieces. The boundary
condition is \(P_{0}=1\).</p>
<p>As another example, consider a population of organisms that takes 2
years to mature after which each pair produces another pair, and
continues to do so each year thereafter.</p>
<p>Each newborn pair plus offspring then has an annual population count of
1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 13…, which may be recognized as the Fibonacci sequence:</p>
<p>$$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$$</p>
<p>with boundary conditions \(a_0 = 1, a_1 = 1\).</p>
<p>The problem with these is that in order to compute the value for
some \(n\), we have to calculate all values all the way from the
boundary condition up to the \(n^{th}\). We’d prefer to just have
some function in terms of \(n\).</p>
<p>There are a number of approaches we can use. We can try to find the
function by inspection, using some number of terms, and then prove the
postulated solution by induction. A related approach is to look at
modified versions of the sequence - for example dividing each term
by \(n\) - to see if a pattern emerges. Adding a constant to each
term before the division may make the pattern more obvious.</p>
<p>If we look at Towers of Hanoi, we can see that the first few terms are
1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63. So a reasonable postulate is:</p>
<p>$$S_n = 2^n - 1$$</p>
<p>It is easy to prove this by induction:</p>
<p>$$S_{n+1} = 2 S_n + 1 = 2 (2^n - 1) + 1 = 2^{n+1} - 1$$</p>
<p>For the regions of the plane, we can use the second approach. Simple
division by \(n\) doesn’t offer a clear pattern, but if we first
subtract 1 from each term, i.e. look at the sequence
\(\frac{P_n-1}{n}\), we get the sequence 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, …, and
a clear pattern emerges. It appears that:</p>
<p>$$\frac{P_n-1}{n} = \frac{n+1}{2}$$</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>$$P_n = \frac{n (n+1)}{2} + 1$$</p>
<p>Once again by induction:</p>
<p>$$\begin{align}
P_{n+1} &amp; = P_n + n + 1 \\
        &amp; = (\frac{n (n+1)}{2}+1) + n + 1 \\
        &amp; = \frac{n^2 + 2 + 2n}{2} + 1 \\
        &amp; = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}+1
\end{align}$$</p>
<p>As for the Fibonacci sequence, that is a topic for another day!</p>

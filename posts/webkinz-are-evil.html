<p>My daughter bought a Webkinz today. These are cheap stuffed animals that
sell at a premium because they have a 'secret code' that allow you to
access the Webkinz website and play games, etc. So of course she wanted
me to set her up to access the site (her PC was locked down to only
allow access to PBS Kids).</p>
<p>We go to the site, sign her up, and then sign in. This launches a new
window running an Adobe Flash app. The URL is not even tied to a domain,
but uses a numeric IP address. After watching it flash 'Loading' for a
while, we get a picture of a green field - and nothing happens.
Meanwhile my wife starts complaining from upstairs that the network has
slowed to a total crawl; not only can't she browse but even the LAN is
pretty hosed, with Outlook frozen up while trying to send an e-mail to
the local Exchange server in the next room.</p>
<p>So I'm listening to this fussing from downstairs and up, and eventually
we kill the Webkinz window - and I hear 'Finally!' from upstairs. We try
the Webkinz app again and more complaints come from upstairs. So not
only is the Webkinz site not working, but it's killing the network.</p>
<p>My daughter is getting pretty upset by this stage. I try various
things - adding the webkinz site and the numeric IP to the trusted zone,
installing the latest version of Flash, even installing Firefox - and
none of it works. But Firefox gives some confirmation that it is the
Webkinz app that is killing the network - I see it continuously trying
to connect to some other numeric IP, over and over in rapid succession.</p>
<p>Finally, to get my daughter off my back and placate the wife, I run the
browser as administrator, and the Webkinz crapplication manages to run.
Of course all the parental controls are now toast and this is not a
sustainable solution.</p>
<p>I find it amazing that these people - who have no scruples about
fleecing kids \$10/pop for their made in China junk -  make a site that
requires such a circumvention of basic security measures to allow kids
in. While at the same time having stupid 'pro-kid' features like not
allowing my daughter to choose the name 'fluffballs' for her pet because
it contains a - gasp - dirty word. Heck, it didn't until they so
conspicuously pointed it out.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is a fad that will fade as quickly as it arrived.</p>

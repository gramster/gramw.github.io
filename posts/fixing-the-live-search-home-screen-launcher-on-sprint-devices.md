Several new Sprint phones come with Live Search for Mobile already
installed, with a launch icon on the home page. Unfortunately if you
update the application then this icon stops working. We changed where
the app gets installed whereas the icon Sprint added has a hard-coded
path.

There is a simple fix, however. Install [this CAB
file](http://cid-3690236ea2d48605.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/sprint_patch.cab)
on your Sprint phone and the icon should work again.

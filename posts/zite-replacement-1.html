<p>The two most used apps on my phone are <a href="http://zite.com/">Zite</a> and <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>. Unfortunately last year Zite was bought by Flipboard and has slowly been getting worse. Recently the top sticky article on Zite has been a post on migrating your preferences to Flipboard, but suggests Zite is not much longer for this world.</p>
<p>This would be okay if Flipboard was a suitable replacement, but it isn't. It's very flashy (which I don't like), and just doesn't seem to get things right when it comes to serendipitous discovery of interesting content. My feeling is that it is probably a great app for people who are interested in news and pop culture, but my interests run more specialized; I want to read about certain programming languages and fields of math, computer science and statistics.</p>
<p>A few days ago Zite had a half day outage and I decided that it was time to hedge my bets. If no-one else has made the app that I want, I'll just have to do it myself.</p>
<p>So what is involved? Amongst other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a corpus of documents of potential interest</li>
<li>a way of determining the topics discussed in each document</li>
<li>a way of classifying the documents into a broader set of categories, based on the topics</li>
<li>a way of ranking each document within the category</li>
<li>a database or some other store for the results, and an API to query these</li>
<li>an app to consume the resulting content in a way that is easy to use, efficient, and supports various options like blocking sites that are not interesting, upvoting/downvoting the suggested results to improve future results, and saving/sharing the results. Such an app would require some form of identity for personalization, assume I'm not the only one using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the app part, the rest of these are all back-end server tasks, and while the amount of data to be processed may be large the task is not too hard. As for the app, I realized an easy solution at first is to not build an app at all. There are other ways to consume the results; for example a daily digest e-mail, or saving the results straight to an app like Pocket or Evernote from where they can be read/deleted/etc. This loses the ability to upvote/downvote/etc but that can come later.</p>
<p>As for the corpus of documents that serve as input, there are a number of ways to source these:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSS feeds are an obvious first choice</li>
<li>Digest-style e-mails that contain useful sets of links - e.g. O'Reilly has weekly newsletters in areas like Programming, Big Data, etc that can be great input (especially as it is already curated)</li>
<li>Posting on social community groups like G+ communities</li>
<li>Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn postings by thought leaders </li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ideas; the first source will definitely be RSS feeds though as they have many useful properties in their metadata.</p>
<p>The main other challenge is the classification task. This is typically going to involve supervised machine learning which means you need a large collection of previously classified articles to learn from.  Thankfully RSS includes article categories so hopefully that will be enough to go on.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough talk. In my next posting I'll look at how to do step 2, namely topic extraction, from RSS feeds.</p>

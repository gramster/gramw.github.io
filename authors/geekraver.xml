 is really a science magazine but has good articles of
interest to math fans.
&lt;a href="http://www.mth.uct.ac.za/outreach/digest/archive.php"&gt;Mathematical Digest&lt;/a&gt;
 is a magazine that
has been produced for nearly 50 years now by Professor John
Webb of the University of Cape Town. I grew up on these in high
school and along with Martin Gardner's columns they fuelled my
love of math. I was privileged to be instructed by Prof. Webb
as an undergraduate math student as well; he was regularly
awarded honors as a distinguished teacher and these were
well-deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is &lt;a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/ianstewart.joat/MANIFOLD/manifold_main.html"&gt;Manifold&lt;/a&gt;,
a student magazine of the University
of Warwick, which is where the well-known math professor and
writer Dr Ian Stewart hails from. I haven't looked at these yet
but expect them to be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know of other sources of such magazines let me know in the
comments!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://www.grahamwheeler.com/posts/math-magazines.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

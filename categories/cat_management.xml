He makes a number of good arguments for why metrics, if not used properly, can have unintended consequences. For example, the &lt;em&gt;body count&lt;/em&gt; metric that the US military optimized for in the Vietnam war caused enormous damage while losing the hearts and minds of the populace and resulting in an ignominious defeat. Muller argues that metrics are too often used as a substitute for good judgment. The book is an excellent read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So should we be ignoring metrics? Clearly not, but we need to be cognizant of what metrics we choose and how we use them. We should also distinguish between things which can meaningfully be measured quantitatively versus things that are more suited to qualitative analyses. And we should be wary of metrics being used as an instrument of control by those far removed from the "trenches", so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that we have a problem that can meaningfully be measured in a quantitative way, we need to make sure our metrics meet a number of criteria to be useful. Here are some guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metrics should be &lt;em&gt;actionable&lt;/em&gt;: they should tell you what you should be doing next. If you can't answer the question of what you would do if a metric changed then its probably not a good metric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metrics should be &lt;em&gt;clearly and consistently defined&lt;/em&gt;: changing the definition of a metric can invalidate all the historical record and is very costly. Do the work upfront to make sure the metric is well-defined and measuring what you want, and then don't change the definition unless you can do so retroactively. Ensure that the metric is defined and used consistently across the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metrics should be &lt;em&gt;comparative&lt;/em&gt; over time (so it is useful to aggregate these over fixed periods like week-over-week or monthly - but be cognizant of seasonal effects).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ratios are often better than absolute values&lt;/em&gt; as they are less affected by exogenous factors. Similarly, &lt;em&gt;trends are more important than absolute values&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metrics are most useful if they are &lt;em&gt;leading indicators&lt;/em&gt; so you can take action early. For example, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process"&gt;Work in Progress (WIP)&lt;/a&gt; is a leading indicator, while &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cycle_time"&gt;cycle time&lt;/a&gt; is a trailing indicator. Think of a highway: you can quickly tell if it is overcrowded, before you can tell how long your commute has been delayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good metrics make up a &lt;em&gt;hierarchy&lt;/em&gt;: your team's metrics should roll up to your larger division's metrics which should roll up to top-level business metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metrics should be &lt;em&gt;in tension&lt;/em&gt;: you should try to find metrics that cannot be easily gamed without detrimentally affecting other metrics. Let's say I have a credit risk prediction model and my metric is the number of customers I predict are not credit risks but that default on their debt. I can just predict that every customer is high risk and my metric will look great, but that's bad for the business. So I need another metric that is in tension with this, such as the number of good customers I deny credit to, which must be minimized. More generally in prediction models we use the combination of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;precision&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;recall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metrics should &lt;em&gt;capture different classes of attributes&lt;/em&gt; such as quality and throughput.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need to know when a deviation in a metric is a cause for concern. A good general guideline is that if a metric deviates more than two standard deviations from the mean over some defined period, you should start paying attention, and more than three standard deviations you should be alarmed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saujanya/"&gt;Saujanya Shrivastava&lt;/a&gt; for many fruitful discussions over our metrics from which these guidelines emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://www.grahamwheeler.com/posts/tyranny-of-metrics.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 01:04:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Managing Engineering and Data Science Agile Teams</title><link>https://www.grahamwheeler.com/posts/managing-data-science-and-engineering.html</link><dc:creator>Graham Wheeler</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is very common in modern software engineering organizations to use agile approaches to managing teamwork. At both Microsoft and eBay teams I have managed have used Scrum, which is a reasonably simple and effective approach that offers a number of benefits, such as timeboxing, regular deployments (not necessarily continuous but at least periodic), a buffer between the team and unplanned work, an iterative continuous improvement process through retrospectives, and metrics that can quickly show whether the team is on track or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science work does not fit quite as well into the Scrum approach. I've heard of people advocating for its use, and even at my current team we initially tried to use Scrum for data science, but there are significant challenges. In particular, I like my Scrum teams to break work down to user stories to a size where the effort involved is under two days (ideally closer to half a day). Yes, we use story points, but once the team is calibrated fairly well its still easy to aim for this. Trying to do this for data science work is much harder, especially when it is research work in building new models which is very open-ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach I have taken with my team is an interesting hybrid that seems to be working quite well and is worth sharing.

&lt;p&gt;Maslow described a set of layers of needs with respect to human motivation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physiological - the basic needs for survival (food, water, shelter, air, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safety - health, well-being, security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;love/belonging - friends and family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;esteem - respect of others and (more importantly) self-respect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-actualization - becoming the most you can be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-transcendence - altruism and given of yourself to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow considered the first four to be necessary for mental health and a pre-requisite for self-actualization
and transcendence.
This hierarchy of needs is a useful model; it's not science but can help us understand shortcomings in ourselves
and others that may need addressing to reach our full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this relate to teams and management? We can come up with a similar set of needs for healthy teams 
and team members:

Do you enjoy doing 1-1s with your reports? No? Then you're doing them wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-1s are a valuable and important part of both managing your team and becoming a better manager. You should see them as as much for your benefit as for your reports - arguably more so! Not only are you getting the opportunity to keep your reports on track and on a growth path, but it's a great opportunity to get feedback yourself. Unless you're the kind of manager who thinks managing is all about giving orders and having them carried out, in which case this post isn't for you; go enlist or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons why managers (and employees) don't enjoy 1-1s:

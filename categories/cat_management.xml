&lt;p&gt;Maslow described a set of layers of needs with respect to human motivation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physiological - the basic needs for survival (food, water, shelter, air, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safety - health, well-being, security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;love/belonging - friends and family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;esteem - respect of others and (more importantly) self-respect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-actualization - becoming the most you can be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-transcendence - altruism and given of yourself to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow considered the first four to be necessary for mental health and a pre-requisite for self-actualization
and transcendence.
This hierarchy of needs is a useful model; it's not science but can help us understand shortcomings in ourselves
and others that may need addressing to reach our full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this relate to teams and management? We can come up with a similar set of needs for healthy teams 
and team members:

Do you enjoy doing 1-1s with your reports? No? Then you're doing them wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-1s are a valuable and important part of both managing your team and becoming a better manager. You should see them as as much for your benefit as for your reports - arguably more so! Not only are you getting the opportunity to keep your reports on track and on a growth path, but it's a great opportunity to get feedback yourself. Unless you're the kind of manager who thinks managing is all about giving orders and having them carried out, in which case this post isn't for you; go enlist or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons why managers (and employees) don't enjoy 1-1s:

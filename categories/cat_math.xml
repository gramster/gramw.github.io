 is really a science magazine but has good articles of
interest to math fans.
&lt;a href="http://www.mth.uct.ac.za/outreach/digest/archive.php"&gt;Mathematical Digest&lt;/a&gt;
 is a magazine that
has been produced for nearly 50 years now by Professor John
Webb of the University of Cape Town. I grew up on these in high
school and along with Martin Gardner's columns they fuelled my
love of math. I was privileged to be instructed by Prof. Webb
as an undergraduate math student as well; he was regularly
awarded honors as a distinguished teacher and these were
well-deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is &lt;a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/ianstewart.joat/MANIFOLD/manifold_main.html"&gt;Manifold&lt;/a&gt;,
a student magazine of the University
of Warwick, which is where the well-known math professor and
writer Dr Ian Stewart hails from. I haven't looked at these yet
but expect them to be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know of other sources of such magazines let me know in the

entertained two bored young girls by inventing a new game that he called
Word Links: given two words, change one word to the other by changing a
single letter at a time with the intermediate steps all being valid
words themselves. For example, to change "cold" to "warm", one can use
the steps "cord", "card", "ward". Carroll later popularised this form of
puzzle in a series of articles in Vanity Fair magazine, changing the
name to Doublets - from the "double, double, toil and trouble" witches'
incantation in Shakespeare's Macbeth.

there is just one other person there, and they are using the locker next
to yours and blocking the way. I noticed this a long time ago, and
noticed that others noticed it too, referring to Murphy’s law, or “just
my luck”, or some such explanation. Why does it happen so often?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this the &lt;em&gt;Gym Locker Paradox&lt;/em&gt;. It is related to a much more well
known paradox, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox"&gt;Birthday
Paradox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is
commonly formulated as a puzzle: how many people do you need to have in
a room together before the odds are better than even that two share the
same birthday?

Before the movie we sat around drinking Croatian Schnapps and eating
Chinese food, and the conversation turned to politics. There was general
agreement that our various political systems were highly suspect and not
very democratic, but Ray, the Texan lawyer with the Croatian wife who
had provided the schnapps, explained the Australian system of instant
runoffs and asserted that this was at last a fair system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar with this system, let me explain: voters get to
rank the candidates in order of preference. The votes for everyone’s
first preference are counted, and the candidate who gets the least votes
is eliminated. That candidate is also struck from the voters choices and
the process is repeated until there is a candidate that has more than
50% of the vote.

number representation to recurrence relations, Pythagorean triples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these topics are related, and this is particularly illustrated
when we consider the work of Leonardo of Pisa, better known as Fibonacci
(from the Latin “de filiis Bonacci”, or “of the family of Bonacci”).
Fibonacci was born in 1175, in Pisa, Italy, shortly after the start of
the construction of the famous leaning tower. The city of Pisa was a
maritime republic which had its own colonies, including Bugia (in modern
day Algeria), where Leonardo’s father moved in 1192 to be a clerk in the
customs house. It was here that Fibonacci became acquainted with the
Hindu numerals and zero, and where his Muslim teacher introduced him to
the the great book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://magimathics.com/much-ado-about-nothing"&gt;Al-Jabr
wal-Muqabalah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
Fibonacci subsequently travelled broadly, where he learnt from
mathematicians of different cultures. Around 1200 he returned to Pisa
and began work on his masterpiece &lt;em&gt;Liber Abaci&lt;/em&gt;, which was published in
1202, and begins with these words:

[his horn]; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms
of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ;
and he shall reign for ever and ever.”&lt;/em&gt; (Revelations 11.15, King James
Edition)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christian and Islamic folklore, it is the angel Gabriel who is
considered to be the seventh angel, who announced the coming of
judgement day. An angel with such a huge responsibility clearly needs an
instrument worthy of the task, and indeed there is one: Gabriel’s horn,
also known as Torricelli’s trumpet, after its discoverer, Evangelista
Torricelli, a student of Galileo. Gabriel’s horn has infinite surface
area but finite volume, and is described the rotating the curve
\(y=\frac{1}{x}\) for \(x \geq 1\) around the \(x\) axis.

established the need for formal proofs instead of just conjecture and
rules of thumb, and he established the existence of the irrationals. In
popular culture of course, Pythagoras is more well known for the
Pythagorean theorem – that the square of the hypotenuse of a right
angled triangle is the sum of the squares of the other two sides – but
this was one of the oldest known results in mathematics and in fact
predates Pythagoras by as much as a thousand years. Nonetheless,
Pythagoras provided a formal proof, and the result led him to ask
whether there were rational numbers that worked in the case where the
hypotenuse had the length two. That is, what was the fractional
representation of the square root of two? Pythagoras managed to show
there was none, leading to the discovery of the irrational numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His proof was quite simple. Assume that \(\sqrt{2}\) can be
expressed as a fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) of two whole
numbers \(a\) and \(b\). Assume these are the two smallest
such whole numbers – that is, they have no common divisor allowing the
fraction to be further reduced. Then:

the other digits. Upon hearing this it seems fantastical - how could
people have managed even elementary arithmetic without zero? However, it
is not the concept of “nothing” that was missing, but rather the use of
a zero in other places when representing or recording numbers. For
example, in the number 101, zero is used as a separator, and it is this
concept that was lacking in early number systems.

&lt;p&gt;Number theory really began with Euclid, around 300BC, in books 7 through
9 of his masterwork, &lt;em&gt;The Elements&lt;/em&gt;. It is here that we find the
original definitions of odd and even numbers, prime and composite
numbers, perfect numbers (numbers which are the sum of their factors,
e.g. 6 = 3 + 2 + 1), and more. But the greatest achievements of all were
his proofs that composite numbers are the products of primes, that this
factorization is unique, and that there are an infinity of primes. Most
introductory algebra or number theory classes cover these three great
proofs, but they are worth revisiting for those who may have forgotten.

post&lt;/a&gt;
I described the Babylonian/Sumerian sexagesimal (base 60) counting
system. Unlike this system, most cultures adopted a base 10 counting
system due to the natural inclination to count with the fingers (leading
to the term &lt;em&gt;digits&lt;/em&gt;). Less common were quinary (base 5) systems, but
vigesimal (base 20) were not unusual - for example, this was widespread
in native American culture, including (with a novel variation) the
Mayans. Duodecimal (base 12) has also played a role; we still have
remnants in the groupings of dozens and gross.

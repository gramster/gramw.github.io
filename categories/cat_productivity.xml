discussed&lt;/a&gt; an
interesting approach to planning called Accelerated Planning Technique
from a New Zealand management consultant. Its worth going through the
&lt;a href="http://www.aptplan.com/intro/000000_Start.htm"&gt;mini online seminar&lt;/a&gt;. It
seems pretty woolly and wordy at first, but the example at the end of
the business plan for a restaurant is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://www.grahamwheeler.com/posts/accelerated-planning-technique.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2006 10:53:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Organizing Life</title><link>https://www.grahamwheeler.com/posts/organizing-life.html</link><dc:creator>Graham Wheeler</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tend to be one of those people who accumulates vast amounts of clutter
on my desk, in my room, and in my life, and then every couple of months
has a big cleanout, vowing to maintain the new uncluttered state, but
the cycle just begins again (I blame the laws of thermodynamics). In an
effort to break that cycle I've recently started paying some attention
to David Allen's &lt;a href="http://davidco.com"&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't read his books (part of my clutter is a large number of unread
books; his book was among them for a while until it went back to the
library), but there is enough info on the web to get the idea. There is
also a good description in the wonderful book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596013/wishwatcher-20/"&gt;'Micro-ISV: from Dream to
Reality&lt;/a&gt;'
by Bob Walsh. One of the first things I did was look for software that I
could use to start implementing the GTD approach. The two main
contenders seemed to be Bob Walsh's own &lt;a href="http://safarisoftware.com/"&gt;Masterlist
Professional&lt;/a&gt;, which is very reasonably
priced at \$25, and a Ukrainian product called &lt;a href="http://www.mylifeorganized.net/"&gt;MyLife
Organized&lt;/a&gt;, which costs \$60. I
downloaded both and tried using them.

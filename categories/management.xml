At both Microsoft and eBay teams I have managed have used Scrum, which is a reasonably simple and effective approach that offers a number of benefits, such as timeboxing, regular deployments (not necessarily continuous but at least periodic), a buffer between the team and unplanned work, an iterative continuous improvement process through retrospectives, and metrics that can quickly show whether the team is on track or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science work does not fit quite as well into the Scrum approach. I've heard of people advocating for its use, and even at my current team we initially tried to use Scrum for data science, but there are significant challenges. In particular, I like my Scrum teams to break work down to user stories to a size where the effort involved is under two days (ideally closer to half a day). Yes, we use story points, but once the team is calibrated fairly well its still easy to aim for this. Trying to do this for data science work is much harder, especially when it is research work in building new models which is very open-ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach I have taken with my team is an interesting hybrid that seems to be working quite well and is worth sharing.

&lt;p&gt;Shankar Vedantam has a great NPR show/podcast, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510308/hidden-brain"&gt;"The Hidden Brain"&lt;/a&gt;, and occasional appearances on NPR's All Things Considered.  In December he had a show on Evaluating Personality Tests. It was enjoyable, especially the Harry Potter Sorting Hat references, but I felt it was a missed opportunity because of the focus on Myers-Briggs, and the fact that he mentioned the Big-5 model only in passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Myers-Briggs is not taken very seriously in the psychology world, and Vedantam surprised me with spending so much time on it, given his show's focus on research in psychology. On the other hand, the Big-5 model is taken quite seriously, with many studies and papers based on it and evaluating it in various contexts (take a look, for example, at the Oxford University Press book I link to at the end of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/12/11/569815338/evaluating-personality-tests"&gt;short form NPR segment&lt;/a&gt;, this was the section on Big-5 in its entirety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;VEDANTAM: Many personality researchers put greater stock in a test known as the Big Five [vs Myers-Briggs]. Grant says the Big Five has lots of peer reviewed data to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRANT: We can predict your job performance, your effectiveness in a team with different collaborators, your likelihood of sticking around in a job versus leaving as well as your probability of your marriage surviving, depending on the personality fit between you and your spouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

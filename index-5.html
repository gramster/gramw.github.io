<p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta</a>
 is really a science magazine but has good articles of
interest to math fans.
<a href="http://www.mth.uct.ac.za/outreach/digest/archive.php">Mathematical Digest</a>
 is a magazine that
has been produced for nearly 50 years now by Professor John
Webb of the University of Cape Town. I grew up on these in high
school and along with Martin Gardner's columns they fuelled my
love of math. I was privileged to be instructed by Prof. Webb
as an undergraduate math student as well; he was regularly
awarded honors as a distinguished teacher and these were
well-deserved.</p>
<p>Finally, there is <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/ianstewart.joat/MANIFOLD/manifold_main.html">Manifold</a>,
a student magazine of the University
of Warwick, which is where the well-known math professor and
writer Dr Ian Stewart hails from. I haven't looked at these yet

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>On Christmas day, 1877, Lewis Carroll, author of the Alice books,
entertained two bored young girls by inventing a new game that he called
Word Links: given two words, change one word to the other by changing a
single letter at a time with the intermediate steps all being valid
words themselves. For example, to change "cold" to "warm", one can use
the steps "cord", "card", "ward". Carroll later popularised this form of
puzzle in a series of articles in Vanity Fair magazine, changing the
name to Doublets - from the "double, double, toil and trouble" witches'
incantation in Shakespeare's Macbeth.</p>
<p>These puzzles are still popular today (usually called Word Ladders). The
noted Stanford computer sciencist Don Knuth dedicated several pages of
his work on graph algorithms (The Stanford Graphbase) to the topic.
Knuth investigated five-letter words and found that of a set of 5,757
common English words, there were 14,135 links between words (where a
link is a single ladder step). Only 671 words had no links - Knuth
called these words 'aloof' - 'aloof' itself being aloof, along with
words such as 'earth', 'ocean', 'sugar' and 'laugh'. 103 pairs such as
'opium' and 'odium' exist. The two biggest connected sets have 25 words
each. By relaxing the rules - for example by allowing the letters to be
rearranged at each step - the words become considerably more connected.</p>
<p>Ted Johnson <a href="//users.rcn.com/ted.johnson/fourletter.htm">conducted an analysis of four letter
words</a>, with the additional
rule of allowing the word to be reversed at any step. Starting with an
online dictionary of 4776 words, he found that there was one huge linked
component of 4436 words. This is not surprising; in 1960 Paul Erdős and
Alfred Rényi proved that if the average number of links is sufficiently
high then<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model">the set of words will form one large connected component with
a few outliers</a>.
Word ladders are interesting because of their similarity to genetic
mutation in DNA. Carroll himself came up with the evolutionary chain
'ape', 'are', 'ere', 'err', 'ear', 'mar', 'man', although he was a
sceptic of Darwin's theories.</p>
<p>Consider the subsequence from 'err' to 'man' - can you prove that to
change one word with a single vowel to another word with a single vowel
but in a different position, that it is necessary to go through an
intermediate step of a word with two vowels? For the purpose of this
problem, consider 'y' to be a vowel.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>It happens so often - you go to your section of the gym change room, and
there is just one other person there, and they are using the locker next
to yours and blocking the way. I noticed this a long time ago, and
noticed that others noticed it too, referring to Murphy’s law, or “just
my luck”, or some such explanation. Why does it happen so often?</p>
<p>I call this the <em>Gym Locker Paradox</em>. It is related to a much more well
known paradox, the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox">Birthday
Paradox</a></em>, which is
commonly formulated as a puzzle: how many people do you need to have in
a room together before the odds are better than even that two share the
same birthday?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/740px-TooManyPigeons.jpg" style="float:left;width:40%;margin:10px"></p>
<p>Obviously in a non-leap year, if there are 366 people you are guaranteed
a matching pair (in the worst case there will be one person for every
day of the year plus one duplicate). This worst case is generalized as
the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle">Pigeonhole
Principle</a></em> - if you
have <em>n</em> items shared between <em>m</em> containers, then if <em>n</em> &gt; <em>m</em> at
least one container will have more than one item.</p>
<p>The answer to the Birthday Paradox is 23. This is because we care only
about any pair matching, not a particular match. There are a large
number of possible pairs in this case.</p>
<p>We can calculate the probability more easily by thinking about the
probability of no match. For one person this is 1. Add a second person
and they for them not to match they must have a birthday on one of the
other 364 days, i.e. the probability of them not matching is 364/365.
Similarly, for the third person not to match they must be on one of the
363 days left, with probability 363/365.</p>
<p>The total probability for n people is then:</p>
<p>$$P(n) = \frac{365}{365} \times \frac{364}{365} \times
\frac{363}{365} \times \ldots \times \frac{(365-n+1)}{365} =
\frac{365!}{365^{n} (365-n)!}$$</p>
<p>which falls below 50% at 23 people.</p>
<p>This result - which many people find surprising - is the basis of what
are known as <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack">Birthday
Attacks</a></em> on cryptographic
hash functions used in computer security. Cryptographic hash functions
compute some value that is treated as a secure “fingerprint” of a much
larger input. For example a digital contract may be “signed” using such
a function. An attacker could use the birthday paradox to try to create
two versions of a contract with the same fingerprint, one of which is
legitimate, then get the legitimate contract approved based on the
fingerprint, and finally substitute the fraudulent one. If just the
fingerprint is used for verification the fraudulent contract will be
accepted. To avoid this kind of attack the number of possible
fingerprints needs to be extremely large before the attack becomes
impractical.</p>
<p>The math behind the gym locker paradox is much more complex. However,
clearly if a locker has multiple neighbors the chance of two people
having adjacent lockers is that much higher (consider a version of the
birthday problem where we consider a collision to be not just a match
but a match within a day or two of each other). Add to that the fact
that gym locker selection is not entirely random (people like lockers at
eye level rather than lower down, for example), and it is no wonder just
a few people can clog up a change room.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Earlier this year I went to a “guys movie night” at a friends house.
Before the movie we sat around drinking Croatian Schnapps and eating
Chinese food, and the conversation turned to politics. There was general
agreement that our various political systems were highly suspect and not
very democratic, but Ray, the Texan lawyer with the Croatian wife who
had provided the schnapps, explained the Australian system of instant
runoffs and asserted that this was at last a fair system.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with this system, let me explain: voters get to
rank the candidates in order of preference. The votes for everyone’s
first preference are counted, and the candidate who gets the least votes
is eliminated. That candidate is also struck from the voters choices and
the process is repeated until there is a candidate that has more than
50% of the vote.</p>
<p><img alt="Marquis de Condorcet" src="images/Marquis_de_condorcet_hd.jpg" style="float:right;size:35%;margin:10px" title="Marquis de Condorcet">
This seems fair on the surface - if someone obviously gets too few votes they
should be out of the running, and everyone gets their preferences for
the remaining candidates counted. But back in 1785, the Marquis de
Condorcet pointed out paradoxes in this system. For example, if there
are three candidates A, B, C and three voters who rank them A-B-C,
B-C-A, and C-A-B, the system is a tie. In general, this is known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_paradox">Condorcet’s paradox</a>.</p>
<p>Still, this system is more fair then the plurality voting systems used
in Canada, India, the UK and the USA, where in each district the winner
takes all. In systems with multiple parties the winner may get way less
than half the vote and still get to represent the entire district. Often
two dominant parties with similar policies will split the vote allowing
a less popular party to win a majority.</p>
<p>Sometimes a hybrid system with a second run-off election between the top
two candidates is used - but due to the vagaries of plurality systems,
the “top two” candidates may not really be the top two at all.</p>
<p>In two party systems like the USA parties mostly compete for the center,
causing the difference between them to become all but irrelevant (in
economics this is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law">Hotelling’s
law</a>). Over time these
systems tend to lose the interest of the voters, occasionally being
re-energized when someone breaks the mold and retargets the extreme
instead, as George W. Bush did.</p>
<p><a href="images/The_Gerry-Mander_Edit.png" style="width:40%;float:left;margin:50px"><img alt="The Gerry-Mander" src="images/573px-The_Gerry-Mander_Edit.png" title="The Gerry-Mander"></a>
Another problem with plurality systems is the way in which voting district
boundaries are drawn up. A candidate may even win the election while
losing the popular vote overall, as George Bush did in 2000. Economic
and other factors often cause areas to have a preference for one party
over another, and ruling parties often exploit this by redrawing
boundaries while they are in power to favor their chances, a process
known as gerrymandering after the 19th century governor of
Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry, who drew up a district map so convoluted
it was compared to a salamander (see photo).</p>
<p>Yet another common system is proportional representation, where each
district has representatives allocated to each party in proportion to
the percentage of votes that party obtained. Once again this is subject
to issues with how districts are divided up. It may seem to make sense
to have just one district, the entire country - the system used in
Israel - but the disadvantage is that voters end up with little control
over which individuals represent them, even if they do have some control
over which parties do. Furthermore, such systems often end up with weak
coalition governments that are hamstrung and ineffective, or in which
minority parties can wield excessive power as “king-makers” for their
bigger rivals.</p>
<p>So what makes a fair system? In 1963 the economist Kenneth Arrow came up
with four attributes that he felt described a fair voting system - and
then went on to prove <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem">Arrow’s impossibility
theorem</a> -
no voting system could satisfy all four conditions. Democracy, it seems,
isn’t.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>In the past few posts I have discussed a diverse set of topics, from
number representation to recurrence relations, Pythagorean triples.</p>
<p>All of these topics are related, and this is particularly illustrated
when we consider the work of Leonardo of Pisa, better known as Fibonacci
(from the Latin “de filiis Bonacci”, or “of the family of Bonacci”).
Fibonacci was born in 1175, in Pisa, Italy, shortly after the start of
the construction of the famous leaning tower. The city of Pisa was a
maritime republic which had its own colonies, including Bugia (in modern
day Algeria), where Leonardo’s father moved in 1192 to be a clerk in the
customs house. It was here that Fibonacci became acquainted with the
Hindu numerals and zero, and where his Muslim teacher introduced him to
the the great book <em><a href="http://magimathics.com/much-ado-about-nothing">Al-Jabr
wal-Muqabalah</a></em>.
Fibonacci subsequently travelled broadly, where he learnt from
mathematicians of different cultures. Around 1200 he returned to Pisa
and began work on his masterpiece <em>Liber Abaci</em>, which was published in
1202, and begins with these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The nine Indian figures are 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1.</p>
<p>With these nine figures, and with the sign 0, which the Arabs call
zephyr, any number whatsoever is written”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the earliest known formal mention of the decadic Hindu-Arabic
number system in the Western world.</p>
<p><a href="images/image15.png" style="float:right;size:35%;margin:10px"><img alt="A page of the Liber Abaci" src="images/image_thumb15.png" title="A page of the Liber Abaci"></a></p>
<p>The <em>Liber Abaci</em> contains a large collection of problems, some aimed at
merchants, but most related to algebra and what would now days be
considered number theory. One of these problems concerned the rate of
reproduction of rabbits, and how the number of pairs of rabbits grows
over successive generations assuming each pair spawns another at each
generation. If each pair takes one generation to mature, then the number
of adult pairs is given by the sequence:</p>
<p>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, …</p>
<p>which are the now-famous Fibonacci numbers, defined by the recurrence
relation:</p>
<p>$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$</p>
<p>These numbers are a source of endless fascination, as they appear in
various guises throughout nature, art, architecture, and mathematics.
For example, the number of spirals of bracts on pineapples and pinecones
are Fibonacci numbers, as are the number of branches on some species of
trees, the number of ancestors at each generation of male bees, and
more. Furthermore, the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers
approaches phi, the golden ratio, which again appears throughout art and
science. Many of these relationships only began to be noticed in the
1800’s, and it was in the mid-1800’s that the name “Fibonacci numbers”
was given them by Edouard Lucas - the inventor of the <a href="http://magimathics.com/the-end-of-the-universe">Tower of
Hanoi</a>
puzzle. Today they still command attention, so much so that there is a
<a href="http://www.fq.math.ca/">quarterly journal</a> dedicated to their
exploration!</p>
<p>Many of these interesting properties of the Fibonacci numbers will be
discussed in future posts; for now, I wish to focus on the relationship
of the Fibonacci numbers to the Pythagorean triples. Before doing so I
need to point out one of the many interesting properties of the
Fibonacci numbers; the proof will be left for another day although you
may want to try obtain it yourself:</p>
<p>$$F_{2n-1} = F_n^2 + F_{n-1}^2$$</p>
<p>Can you prove the following?</p>
<ul>
<li>If we have a succession of four consecutive Fibonacci numbers
    \(a, b, c, d\), then \((2bc, ad, b^2c^2)\) form a
    Pythagorean triple</li>
<li>Is it possible to have a triangle whose sides are all <em>distinct</em>
    Fibonacci numbers? It should be obvious that this is not possible
    with consecutive Fibonacci numbers, but what if we can choose any
    Fibonacci numbers?</li>
</ul>
<p>The first problem is quite easy to prove if we just note that \(c = a + b\)
and \(d = c + b = a + 2b\), and then expand the three
operations in the triple in terms of just \(a\) and \(b\):</p>
<p>$$A = 2bc = 2b ( a + b) = 2ab + 2b^2$$</p>
<p>$$B = ad = a (b + a + b) = a^2 + 2ab$$</p>
<p>$$C = b^2 + c^2 = b^2 + (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2$$</p>
<p>If we then square these results it is trivial to see that \(A^2 + B^2 = C^2\) holds.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if we use two consecutive Fibonacci numbers as the
coefficients in the Babylonian formulae for Pythagorean triples (i.e.
<a href="http://magimathics.com/more-on-diophantus-and-fermat">the formulae given by
Diophantus</a>),
then one of the numbers in the triple is a Fibonacci number. This should
be clear from the property mentioned above, which stated that the sum of
the squares of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers is a Fibonacci number</p>
<p>For the second problem, assume we have three distinct Fibonacci numbers,
\(F_a\), \(F_b\) and \(F_c\), ordered by size, so
that:</p>
<p>$$F_a \leq F_{b-1}$$</p>
<p>$$F_{b+1} \leq F_c$$</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>$$F_a + F_b \leq F_{b+1}$$</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>$$F_a + F_b \leq F_c$$</p>
<p>which contradicts the <em>triangle inequality</em> - namely that the sum of any
two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.</p>

<p>“<a href="http://bible.cc/revelation/11-15.htm"></a><em>And the seventh angel sounded
[his horn]; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms
of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ;
and he shall reign for ever and ever.”</em> (Revelations 11.15, King James
Edition)</p>
<p>In Christian and Islamic folklore, it is the angel Gabriel who is
considered to be the seventh angel, who announced the coming of
judgement day. An angel with such a huge responsibility clearly needs an
instrument worthy of the task, and indeed there is one: Gabriel’s horn,
also known as Torricelli’s trumpet, after its discoverer, Evangelista
Torricelli, a student of Galileo. Gabriel’s horn has infinite surface
area but finite volume, and is described the rotating the curve
\(y=\frac{1}{x}\) for \(x \geq 1\) around the \(x\) axis.</p>
<p><a href="images/image13.png" style="float:right;size:35%;margin:10px"><img alt="image" src="images/image_thumb13.png" title="image"></a></p>
<p>It is easy to see that this shape, which extends to infinity along the
positive \(x\) axis but gets thinner and thinner, must have
infinite surface area. It is less obvious that it has finite volume,
although this can be shown with elementary calculus (if you’re
unfamiliar with the calculus needed for surface area of revolution and
solid volume of revolution, just bear with me).</p>
<p>The volume is given by:</p>
<p>$$V = \pi \int_{1}^{a} \frac{1}{x^2} dx = \pi (1 - \frac{1}{a})$$</p>
<p>While the surface area is given by:</p>
<p>$$A = 2 \pi \int_{1}^{a} \frac{\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{x^4}}}{x} dx &gt; 2 \pi \int_{1}^{a} \frac{\sqrt{1}}{x} dx = 2 \pi ln(a)$$</p>
<p>Clearly in the limit \(a \rightarrow \infty\), we have:</p>
<p>$$V = \pi$$</p>
<p>$$A = \infty$$</p>
<p>At the time that Torricelli discovered this (1641), calculus had not yet
been invented, and he obtained the results by a technique developed by
his friend Cavalieri, called the summation of plane slices - essentially
a technique similar to the calculus of limits using successively smaller
slices. This itself required a leap of faith at the time and only became
solidified later, as the idea of limits took hold, and the concept of
infinitely many infinitely thin slices was given a rigorous mathematical
foundation.</p>
<p>Torricelli’s trumpet caused some consternation and disbelief - in 1672,
for example, Thomas Hobbes, the English philosopher, claimed that to
believe Torricelli would be madness. It appears to result in a paradox,
the <em>painter’s paradox</em>: if the volume is finite, the horn can be filled
with a finite amount of paint, and yet to cover its interior surface
would require an infinite amount of paint! Before reading on, can you
resolve this paradox?</p>
<p>The paradox comes from confusing our mental model of real paint with
“mathematical” paint. Real paint has a finite thickness - say the
thickness of a paint molecule. At some point the trumpet becomes thinner
than this, and so with real paint we could neither fill the trumpet nor
cover its surface. The only paint that could do this would be
“mathematical” paint that has infinitely small thickness. A finite
amount of infinitely thin paint could cover an infinite
surface.<a href="images/image14.png" style="float:right;size:35%;margin:10px"><img alt="image" src="images/image_thumb14.png" title="image"></a></p>
<p>While he made a number of contributions to mathematics, Torricelli is
more well known for his contributions to physics. He was the first
scientist to create a sustained vacuum and suggested the experiments
that led to the invention of the barometer; later he went on to use the
much more effective mercury in place of water. In his honour the vacuum
in a barometer is known as a Torricelli vacuum, and the Torr is a
measure of vacuum. He gave the first scientific explanation for wind,
which he recognized as being caused by variations in air density caused
by temperature differences. He was a skilled lens maker and his
telescopes and microscopes provided much of his income. Sadly, he
contracted typhoid and died at the age of 39  in 1647;  not all his
writing and research was preserved, and had he lived longer he may well
have been credited with being the inventor of integral calculus; he was
well on the way to understanding its principles.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Pythagoras is known for two great contributions to mathematics – he
established the need for formal proofs instead of just conjecture and
rules of thumb, and he established the existence of the irrationals. In
popular culture of course, Pythagoras is more well known for the
Pythagorean theorem – that the square of the hypotenuse of a right
angled triangle is the sum of the squares of the other two sides – but
this was one of the oldest known results in mathematics and in fact
predates Pythagoras by as much as a thousand years. Nonetheless,
Pythagoras provided a formal proof, and the result led him to ask
whether there were rational numbers that worked in the case where the
hypotenuse had the length two. That is, what was the fractional
representation of the square root of two? Pythagoras managed to show
there was none, leading to the discovery of the irrational numbers.</p>
<p>His proof was quite simple. Assume that \(\sqrt{2}\) can be
expressed as a fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) of two whole
numbers \(a\) and \(b\). Assume these are the two smallest
such whole numbers – that is, they have no common divisor allowing the
fraction to be further reduced. Then:</p>
<p>$$\frac{a^2}{b^2} = 2$$</p>
<p>so:</p>
<p>$$a^2 = 2 b^2$$</p>
<p>The right hand side is even, which means \(a^2\) is even, and
thus \(a\) must be even, or \(a=2m\) for some \(m\). But
then:</p>
<p>$${(2m)}^2 = 2b^2$$</p>
<p>so:</p>
<p>$$2m^2 = b^2$$</p>
<p>So the left hand side is even, and thus \(b\) must be even. But if
both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, then they have a common factor
2, which contradicts the assumption that they were the smallest such
numbers.</p>
<p>There are, of course, infinitely many cases where the Pythagorean
triangles have sides with rational length, and for that matter, integer
length. In a <a href="http://magimathics.com/more-on-diophantus-and-fermat">recent
post</a>
I mentioned the method described by Diophantus that inspired Fermat’s
last theorem. It is easy to derive this method. Assume \(a\)
and \(b\) are relatively prime, and that \(b\) is odd. Then:</p>
<p>$${(a+b)}^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab &gt; a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$</p>
<p>Thus \(c &lt; a+b\). So we can write \(c = a+b-d\) for some
positive \(d\). Then:</p>
<p>$$a^2 + b^2 = {(a+b-d)}^2 = a^2 + b^2 + d^2 + 2ab -2ad -2bd$$</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>$$d^2 = 2ad + 2bd - 2ab$$</p>
<p>From this we can see \(d\) must be even. Let \(d=2m\); then:</p>
<p>$$4m^2 = 4am+4bm-2ab$$</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>$$ab=2am+2bm-2m^2$$</p>
<p>Thus \(ab\) is even, and as we assumed \(b\) is odd, \(
a\) must be even. Since the sum of an even and an odd is an odd, \(
c^2\) must be odd and so \(c\) must be odd.</p>
<p>So \(a\) is even, and \(b\) and \(c\) are odd. We can
write \(b=s-t\) and \(c=s+t\) for some integers \(s\)
and \(t\). Then:</p>
<p>$$a^2 + {(s-t)}^2 = {(s+t)}^2$$</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>$$a^2 + (s^2 - 2st + t^2) = (s^2 + 2st + t^2)$$</p>
<p>Simplifying:</p>
<p>$$a^2 = 4st$$</p>
<p>So \(st\) must be a perfect square. We can write \(s=u^2\)
and \(t=v^2\). Thus:</p>
<p>$$a^2 = 4u^2v^2$$</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>$$a=2uv$$</p>
<p>So we have shown that a Pythagorean triple takes the form:</p>
<p>$$( 2uv, u^2-v^2, u^2 + v^2 )$$</p>

<p>Many people have heard that the number zero was introduced later than
the other digits. Upon hearing this it seems fantastical - how could
people have managed even elementary arithmetic without zero? However, it
is not the concept of “nothing” that was missing, but rather the use of
a zero in other places when representing or recording numbers. For
example, in the number 101, zero is used as a separator, and it is this
concept that was lacking in early number systems.</p>
<p><a href="images/image10.png" style="float:right;size:35%;margin:10px"><img alt="Medieval tallies" src="images//image_thumb10.png" title="Medieval tallies"></a></p>
<p>We are used to our modern decimal representation where each digit
represents units, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. Not all systems worked
that way - the Roman system is a well-known example of a different
approach. Throughout history there have been many alternative ways of
recording numbers. In ancient China and the South Sea islands knots in
string were used. Creating notches in sticks is another (the word
<em>score</em> has its roots in this method, as do the Roman numerals I, II,
III). Contracts were often formalized by scoring a piece of wood with an
appropriate count then splitting it in two with each party taking half;
the halves would be matched up later to ensure no alteration. <a href="images/image11.png" style="float:right;size:35%;margin:10px"><img alt="The
burning of the Parliament, painted by
Turner" src="images/image_thumb11.png" title="The burning of the Parliament, painted by Turner"></a></p>
<p>In Britain such Exchequer tallies were used from the 12th century and
were legally binding until 1826; in 1834 the burning of the no-longer
required tallies started a fire that destroyed the old Parliament
buildings.</p>
<p>The use of simple score marks developed with writing into more
sophisticated forms. Different symbols were used for values of different
magnitudes, and they were repeated as necessary (e.g. III for 3, and CCC
for 300 in Rome). The use of subtractive methods (IV instead of IIII)
was a later innovation.</p>
<p>This simple grouping approach evolved into a multiplicative approach,
where instead of repeating a symbol it was preceded with a count. For
example, if that were applied to Roman numbers we might write 3C3V for
315. A real example is the Chinese-Japanese number system.</p>
<p>A different approach is a ciphered approach, where there are separate
symbols for the ten symbols 0 through 9, then the nine symbols 10 , 20,
30 through 90, then 100, 200, 300 through 900, and so on. Examples of
this are the Hindu Brahmi and the Egyptian hieratic and demotic systems.
Variations on this, where alphabetic characters were repurposed for
numbers, are the Greek numerals, Hebrew, Syrian and Gothic systems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of these systems are ill-suited for calculations, as
anyone who has attempted math on Roman numerals will know. Performing
arithmetic was thus considered an advanced art and required the
assistance of tools such as the abacus.  It was only with the spread of
the Hindu-Arabic decadic positional system around 800AD that arithmetic
operations became easy to perform without assistance. It was positional
systems that necessitated the introduction of a symbol to represent no
value at a particular position, to distinguish, for example, 31 from
301. The lack of a zero made the earlier positional systems such as the
Babylonian sexagesimal system highly ambiguous, although the Mayans
developed an early positional representation system that included a
zero, which may account for why their mathematical calculations were
considerably more advanced and accurate than other cultures.</p>

wal-Muqabalah" src="images/image_thumb12.png" title="A page of Al-Jabr wal-Muqabalah "></a></p>
<p>The spread of the Hindu-Arabic system was largely facilitated by the
translation into Latin of the text <em>Al-Jabr wal-Muqabalah</em> (hence:
algebra) by the great Arab mathematician Mohammed ibn Musa
al-Khowarizmi.  The use of this system became known as algorism (leading
to the modern word algorithm) , but its adoption took time; the abacists
who adhered to the Roman system resisted the algorismic system and it
took until the 16th century for it to become predominant in Europe.</p>

<p><a href="images/image9.png" style="float:right;size:35%;margin:10px"><img alt="image" src="images/image_thumb9.png" title="image"></a></p>
<p>Number theory really began with Euclid, around 300BC, in books 7 through
9 of his masterwork, <em>The Elements</em>. It is here that we find the
original definitions of odd and even numbers, prime and composite
numbers, perfect numbers (numbers which are the sum of their factors,
e.g. 6 = 3 + 2 + 1), and more. But the greatest achievements of all were
his proofs that composite numbers are the products of primes, that this
factorization is unique, and that there are an infinity of primes. Most
introductory algebra or number theory classes cover these three great
proofs, but they are worth revisiting for those who may have forgotten.</p>
<p>Before doing so, it is worth revisiting Euclid’s clever algorithm for
calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. We made
use of this when solving the <a href="http://magimathics.com/monkeying-around">Monkey and Coconuts
puzzle</a>.</p>
<p>We divide the smaller number into the larger and keep track of the
remainder. Then we divide that remainder into the smaller number to get
a second remainder, then divide the second remainder into the first
remainder to get a third remainder, and so on. Eventually we get a
remainder of zero; the remainder just before this is the GCD. If this
happens to be one, we say the numbers are coprime. For example, consider
64 and 10:</p>
<ul>
<li>64 = 10 x 6 + 4</li>
<li>10 = 4 x 2 + 2</li>
<li>4 = 2 x 2 + 0</li>
</ul>
<p>So the GCD is 2.</p>
<p>For another example, consider 77 and 65:</p>
<ul>
<li>77 = 65 x 1 + 12</li>
<li>65 = 12 x 5 + 5</li>
<li>12 = 5 x 2 + 2</li>
<li>5 = 2 x 2 + 1</li>
<li>2 = 1 x 2 + 0</li>
</ul>
<p>So the GCD is 1 and the numbers are coprime.</p>
<p>In the proofs below we make use of a special case of Bézout's identity,
which states that if two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) have a
GCD \(g\), then there exists some \(x\) and \(y\) such
that \(ax + by = g\). In our case we care about the situation
where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime, so that there exists
some \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = 1\). We aren’t
proving that here but it is exactly equivalent to solving the
Diophantine equations we solved for the <a href="http://magimathics.com/monkeying-around">Monkey and Coconuts
problem</a>
(where  \(x\) and  \(y\) where the number of coconuts at the
start and end).</p>
<p><strong><em>Proof that Composite Numbers have Prime Factors</em></strong></p>
<p>Let \(A\) be a composite number. Then by definition \(A\) must
be divisible by some smaller number \(B\). If \(B\) is prime
we are done; if \(B\) is not prime it is must be divisible by some
smaller number \(C\), and so on. Continuing in this way, we find:</p>
<p>$$A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; \dots &gt; 1$$</p>
<p>This sequence must terminate with a prime number in the last position
before 1; if not, that is, if each successive number is still composite,
then the series is infinite, but we cannot have an infinite series of
decreasing whole numbers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Prime Factorization Theorem (aka the Unique Factorization Theorem aka
the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)</em></strong></p>
<p>There are two steps: first we show that if a prime \(p\) divides a
composite \(ab\), then \(p\) must divide at least one
of \(a\) or \(b\). Assume \(p\) does not divide \(
a\) - then the GCD (greatest common divisor) of \(p\) and \(
a\) must be 1, as \(p\) is prime. By Bézout's identity, there must
be some integers \(x\) and \(y\) satisfying \(px + ay =
1\). Multiplying both sides by \(b\) gives \(pxb+aby = b\),
and both terms on the left hand side are products of \(p\),
thus \(b\) must be a product of \(p\).</p>
<p>Now for the main proof. Let \(s\) be the smallest natural number
that can be written as a product of prime numbers in more than one way
(ignoring ordering, of course). Let one factorization be \(p_1
p_2 \dots p_m\) and another be \(q_1 q_2 \dots q_n\). The
previous result proves that \(p_1\) divides either \(q_1\)
or \(q_2 \dots q_n\). Because both  \(q_1\) and  \(
q_2 \dots q_n\) must have unique prime factorizations, \(p_1\)
must equal some \(q_i\). If we then remove \(p_1\)
and \(q_i\)  we have two different factorizations of a number
\(\frac{s}{p_1}\) which is smaller than \(s\), which
contradicts our assumption that \(s\) is the smallest such number.</p>
<p><strong><em>Proof of the Infinitude of the Primes</em></strong></p>
<p>Assume the set of primes is finite, given by \({ p_1, p_2,
\dots, p_n }\). Consider the number  \(p = p_1 p_2 p_3 \dots
p_n + 1\). This is not divisible by any of the primes in the set; it
always leaves a remainder of 1. Therefore it is either itself prime or
has other prime divisors not in the set, and so the set is incomplete.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.magimathics.com/babylonian-numbers-in-60-seconds">previous
post</a>
I described the Babylonian/Sumerian sexagesimal (base 60) counting
system. Unlike this system, most cultures adopted a base 10 counting
system due to the natural inclination to count with the fingers (leading
to the term <em>digits</em>). Less common were quinary (base 5) systems, but
vigesimal (base 20) were not unusual - for example, this was widespread
in native American culture, including (with a novel variation) the
Mayans. Duodecimal (base 12) has also played a role; we still have
remnants in the groupings of dozens and gross.</p>
<p>Once the numbers in the base group are exceeded, we need to group to
represent larger numbers - for example in decimal we have units, tens,
tens of tens (hundreds), and so on. The Mayans used a novel variation
where the second grouping only went up to 18, although after this the
groupings reverted to base 20 again. This means the second order group
represents numbers up to 360 rather than 400, and may relate to the
Mayan calendar of 18 months of 20 days plus 5 extra days.</p>
<p>The larger groupings have names that are often quite recent
introductions to language; while the term <em>hundred</em> can be traced back
to a root meaning <em>ten times (ten)</em>, the word <em>thousand</em> has no clear
relation to the roots of Indo-European languages and is likely quite a
late construction, seemingly from an early Germanic term meaning <em>great
hundred</em>. An exception was the Hindus who seemed attracted to large
numbers; there is a story from the life of the Buddha which mentions
numbers up to \(2^{153}\). The Greeks typically stopped at
<em>myriad</em> (ten thousand), and for a long time the Roman number system
stopped at 100,000; the term for a <em>million</em> appeared around 1400AD in
Italy. Numbers larger than a million have appeared so recently in
European language that there is no common agreement - a <em>billion</em> in
Europe is \(10^{12}\) while in America it is \(10^9\)
(called a <em>milliard</em> in Europe), and things get worse for trillion and
quadrillion.</p>

(1620)" src="images/archimedes_thumb.png" title="Archimedes Thoughtful by Fetti (1620)"></a></p>
<p>One of the first known efforts to systematize the number system to
encompass large numbers is Archimedes’ <em><a href="http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Archimedes/SandReckoner/SandReckoner.html">The Sand
Reckoning</a></em>,
a treatise addressed to his relative King Gelo of Syracuse, in which
Archimedes constructs a systematic method for representing arbitrarily
large numbers while addressing the problem of estimating the number of
grains of sand in the universe. In his preface, he stated “There are
some, King Gelo, who think that the number of the sand is infinite in
multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about
Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every
region whether inhabited or uninhabited.” Archimedes went on to use
myriads raised to the the power of myriads, successively, to represent
the very large numbers he needed for his calculations. In the process of
doing this Archimedes discovered and proved the law of exponents:</p>
<p>$$10^a 10^b = 10^{a+b}$$</p>
<p>Archimedes had to estimate the size of the universe. He assumed a
heliocentric model, with the earth revolving around the sun, the sun at
the center, and the stars at the periphery. By his estimates the
universe was about two light years across. Given we now know the next
closest star to our sun is about 4 lights years away this was quite
impressive for the time!</p>
